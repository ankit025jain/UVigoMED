{"id":33644,"title":"A late-onset and mild form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 caused by a novel splice-site mutation within the Mitofusin-2 gene.","abstract":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A disease (CMT2A) caused by mutations in the Mitofusin 2 gene (Mfn2) has been shown to be an early-onset axonal neuropathy with severe clinical course in the majority of the patients. In this study we present a unique phenotype of CMT2A disease characterized by late-onset polyneuropathy with a very mild clinical course. This rare form of CMT2A disease is caused by a new splice-site (c.311+1G>T) mutation within the MFN2 gene. Due to disturbance of the MFN2 splicing process, this mutation generates a short transcript which encodes a very short fragment of MFN2 protein. The c.311+1G>T mutation within the MFN2 gene results in the late -onset CMT2 disease.
