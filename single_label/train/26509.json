{"id":26509,"title":"Chylopericardium: a case report demonstrating utility of lymphography combined with 3D computed tomography for corrective surgical treatment using VATS.","abstract":"We present a case of a 58 year-old woman with primary chylopericardium associated with chylothorax. Chylopericardium is a condition in which chylous fluid containing a high concentration of triglycerides accumulates in the pericardial cavity, and it can form for many different reasons. 3D computed tomography with lymphography precisely depicted the specific location of the lymphatic leak in this patient, which was successfully repaired using targeted video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109168","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.771083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thoracic surgery","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.376015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Lymphogram","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphogram"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Chyle","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chyle"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chylothorax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylothorax"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
