{"id":47513,"title":"[Laparoscopic total gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy and intracorporal circular stapled esophagojejunostomy].","abstract":"Laparoscopic total gastrectomy for early and advanced gastric cancer is an exacting procedure which is increasingly performed in specialised institutions. Not only gastric resection and extended lymphadenectomy but especially the reconstruction by oesophagojejunostomy is a technically demanding and vulnerable operative step. In this article we present our laparoscopic technique of total gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy and complete intracorporal reconstruction by end-to-side circular stapled oesophagojejunostomy. The operative technique of the gastric resection, the extended lymphadenectomy and the reconstruction are described in detail in a step-by-step approach and demonstrated in a supplemental video.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585190","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.426916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.192222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.186848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.0972222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0335392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Surgical staple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_staple"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
