{"id":66575,"title":"Breath analysis of ammonia, volatile organic compounds and deuterated water vapor in chronic kidney disease and during dialysis.","abstract":"The volatile metabolites present in trace amounts in exhaled breath of healthy individuals and patients, for example those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), can now be detected and quantified by sensitive analytical techniques. In this review, special attention is given to the major retention metabolites resulting from dialysis-dependent CKD stage 5 and especially ammonia, as a potential estimator of the severity of uremia. However, other biomarkers are important, including the hydrocarbons isoprene, ethane and pentane, in that they are likely to indicate tissue injury associated with the dialysis treatment itself. Evaluation of over-hydration, a serious complication of CKD stage5 can be improved by analysis of deuterium in exhaled water vapor after ingestion of a known amount of deuterated water, so providing total body water measurements at the bedside to support clinical management of volume status.
