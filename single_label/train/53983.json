{"id":53983,"title":"[Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog combined with stanazolol on final height in girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty and apparent decrease of linear growth].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of combined use of stanazolol (ST) on the final adult height (FAH) in girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP) and apparently decreased linear growth during gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) therapy.Sixty-three girls with ICPP and decreased velocity of growth of height (HV<4 cm/yr) during GnRHa therapy were divided into 3 groups based on the following types of interventions:group 1 (n = 20), GnRHa+ST [25-30 µg/(kg·d) every 3-month followed by 3-month discontinuation], group 2 (n = 21), GnRHa+recombinant human growth hormone [rhGH, 1-1.1 U/(kg·w)], group 3 (n = 22), GnRHa alone.HV, the advancement of bone age (BA) for chronological age (CA) (?BA/?CA) and FAH were compared among groups.(1)Total duration of ST combination therapy was (12.22 ± 3.62) months, while total duration of combination of rhGH was (13.22 ± 6.80) months. (2)HV increased significantly in both group 1 [ (2.79 ± 0.60) cm/yr vs. (6.27 ± 1.98) cm/yr, P < 0.01] and in group 2 [(2.80 ± 0.50) cm/yr vs. (6.25 ± 1.98) cm/yr, P < 0.01] during combined therapy, but maintained at low levels in group 3 [(3.95 ± 1.10) cm/yr vs. (3.34 ± 0.95) cm/yr, P > 0.05].No significant differences of ?BA/?CA were found among the three groups [0.25(0.11?0.28), 0.22(0.15?0.31),0.19(0.10?0.32), P > 0.05]. (3)FAH was significantly higher than predicted adult height (PAH) before combined therapy, as well as higher than target height (THt) in both group 1 [(156.25 ± 2.90) cm vs. (150.78 ± 3.70) cm, P < 0.01, (156.25 ± 2.90) cm vs. (153.94 ± 2.62) cm, P < 0.01], and in group2 [ (157.33 ± 4.69) cm vs. (152.61 ± 3.92) cm, P < 0.01, (157.33 ± 4.69) cm vs. (154.39 ± 4.72) cm, P = 0.01].In group 3, FAH was similar to PAH [(153.88 ± 2.6) cm vs. (152.54 ± 5.86) cm, P > 0.05], and was less than THt [(153.88 ± 2.6) cm vs. (155.60 ± 4.52) cm, P = 0.02]. (4)In girls treated with ST, no hirsutism, clitorism or hoarse voice was recorded.No polycystic ovary syndrome was found by B-mode ultrasound.Intermittent combined use of low dose ST therapy can increase HV and thus improve FAH in girls with ICPP and apparently decreased linear growth during GnRHa therapy.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System
