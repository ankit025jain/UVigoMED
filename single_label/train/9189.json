{"id":9189,"title":"Is adenomyosis a problem in reproduction and fertility?","abstract":"Adenomyosis is defined as the presence of glandular foci beside the endometrium of uterus: in the myometrium and/or perimetrium depending on the progress of the disorder. So far, adenomyosis has been diagnosed in women and rodents, and studies conducted on cows have been rare. In this review we: (1) summarize the knowledge regarding adenomyosis, (2) compare the symptoms and aetiopathology between women and cows, (3) describe angiogenic uterine processes related to adenomyosis development and (4) outline the influence of adenomyosis on proper fertility processes in cattle (conception and fertility rates).","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724491","annotations":[{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.386317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Myometrium","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myometrium"},{"name":"Perimetrium","weight":0.203312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetrium"},{"name":"Adenomyosis","weight":0.200556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomyosis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.199671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.144639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Lesbian","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.0684916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.0315646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Total fertility rate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate"}]}
