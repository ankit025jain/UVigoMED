{"id":32740,"title":"Organochlorine pesticide levels in maternal serum and risk of neural tube defects in offspring in Shanxi Province, China: a case-control study.","abstract":"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in placental tissue have been reported to be associated with an increased risk for fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). Our case-control study was performed to explore the association between maternal serum OCP concentration and NTD risk in offspring. Serum samples were collected from 117 mothers who delivered NTD infants (case group) and 121 mothers who delivered healthy infants (control group). Only three of the 25 OCPs were detected in more than half of the maternal serum samples. The median concentration of total OCPs in the case group was significantly higher than that of the control group. However, no dose-response relationships between higher levels of any individual OCPs or total OCPs and the risk of NTDs or subtypes were observed in either the unadjusted binary unconditional logistic regression model or the model adjusted by potential confounders. We conclude that no clear association between maternal serum OCP residues and NTD risk in offspring was observed in this population.No clear association between maternal serum levels of organochlorine pesticides and risk of neural tube defects in offspring was observed for a Chinese population.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24911776","annotations":[{"name":"Pesticide","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"},{"name":"China","weight":0.701504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Organochloride","weight":0.573055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organochloride"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.572164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.420845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.399697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.135883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Shanxi","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"NTD","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTD"}]}
