{"id":63834,"title":"[A case of gastric cancer accompanied by disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow successfully controlled by S-1 and cisplatin combination therapy].","abstract":"We report a case of gastric cancer accompanied by disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow treated with S-1 and cisplatin( CDDP) combination chemotherapy. The patient was a 68-year-old woman who was detected as having disseminated intravascular coagulation( DIC) during an examination for gastric cancer and she was diagnosed as having disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow by lumbar puncture. She was immediately treated with S-1 and CDDP combination chemotherapy( S-1, 80 mg/body orally administered[ po] on days 1-21 and CDDP, 60 mg/body intravenously [iv] administered on day 8) and her DIC improved on the fourth day. Subsequently, the patient was treated with 3 courses of combination chemotherapy and she survived for 184 days from the initiation of the treatment. Although disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow is associated with a poor prognosis, we believe that the duration of survival of our patient was extended due to initiation of chemotherapy at an early stage.
