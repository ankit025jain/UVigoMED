{"id":30625,"title":"Bi-weekly liposomal doxorubicin for advanced breast cancer in elderly women (? 70 years).","abstract":"We conducted a multicenter prospective trial to assess tolerability and activity of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in women ? 70 years with locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer.All patients underwent Multidimensional Geriatric Assessment (MGA). Frail patients were excluded. Normal cardiac function was required for inclusion. A bi-weekly schedule of PLD at 20mg/mq was adopted.Thirty-two patients were enrolled with a median age of 78 years, 78.1% with visceral involvement, and 37.6% previously treated with chemotherapy for advanced disease. A mean of 7.8 cycles were delivered (range 1 to 20), with a median cumulative dose intensity of 8.9 mg/m(2)/week. Grade 3-4 toxicities were anemia (6.3%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (6.3%), mucositis (6.3%), infection (3.1%), and pulmonary embolism (3.1%). No cardiac events were registered. Causes of treatment interruption were maximal response (15.6%), progression (40.6%), refusal/loss to follow-up (28.1%), toxicities (9.4%), or other (6.3%). Response was obtained in 33.3% of 27 evaluable patients; median time to progression (TTP) was 10.3 months. MGA status (vulnerable vs. fit) did not have an impact on response, progression, and toxicity.Bi-weekly PLD is well tolerated in both fit and vulnerable patients, with an apparently fairly good response rate and TTP (possibly biased by subsequent endocrine therapy and loss to follow-up). Close observation of patients is recommended in order to avoid early refusal/loss to follow-up.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472477","annotations":[{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.579261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.447891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.264101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Metastatic breast cancer","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"}]}
