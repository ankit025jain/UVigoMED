{"id":12332,"title":"Paradoxical effect of TrkA inhibition in Alzheimer's disease models.","abstract":"An unbiased screen for compounds that block amyloid-? protein precursor (A?PP) caspase cleavage identified ADDN-1351, which reduced A?PP-C31 by 90%. Target identification studies showed that ADDN-1351 is a TrkA inhibitor, and, in complementary studies, TrkA overexpression increased A?PP-C31 and cell death. TrkA was shown to interact with A?PP and suppress A?PP-mediated transcriptional activation. Moreover, treatment of PDAPP transgenic mice with the known TrkA inhibitor GW441756 increased sA?PP? and the sA?PP? to A? ratio. These results suggest TrkA inhibition-rather than NGF activation-as a novel therapeutic approach, and raise the possibility that such an approach may counteract the hyperactive signaling resulting from the accumulation of active NGF-TrkA complexes due to reduced retrograde transport. The results also suggest that one component of an optimal therapy for Alzheimer's disease may be a TrkA inhibitor.
