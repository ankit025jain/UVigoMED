{"id":72541,"title":"Solitary plasmacytoma of the index finger.","abstract":"Solitary osseous plasmacytoma rarely involves the distal extremities. We report a case and provide a brief review of the relevant literature.We report a 64-year-old man who presented with swelling, mild pain and a deformed right index finger. The workup led to the diagnosis of solitary osseous plasmacytoma and the patient eventually required amputation of his finger. With clinical follow-up, the disease spread to regional lymph nodes and subsequently the patient developed systemic involvement and received chemotherapy.Solitary osseous plasmacytoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of distal extremity neoplasms.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964361","annotations":[{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.837189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.784866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.701007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.430984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.36434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.309583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.304822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Plasmacytoma","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmacytoma"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Solitary (TV series)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_(TV_series)"}]}
