{"id":28189,"title":"Occurrence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus in retail raw oysters from the eastern coast of Thailand.","abstract":"Occurrence, population density and virulence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus in 240 retail raw oysters collected monthly between March 2010 and February 2011 from Ang Sila coast, Chon Buri Province, Thailand were determined using most probable number (MPN) multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR detected V. parahaemolyticus in 219 raw oyster samples, of which 29 samples contained the virulence tdh. MPN values for V. parahaemolyticus and pathogenic strains in most samples ranged from 10 to 10(2) and from 3 to 10 MPN/g, respectively. The presence of V. vulnificus was found in 53 oyster samples in amounts between 10 and 10(2) MPN/g. Of 1,087 V. parahaemolyticus isolates, 14 and 2 isolates carried tdh and virulence trh, respectively but none with both genes. However, none of the presumptive isolates was shown to be V. vulnificus. The detection of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus in raw oysters has rendered high awareness of risk in consumption of raw or undercooked oysters.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974651","annotations":[{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Oyster","weight":0.514435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Vibrio vulnificus","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_vulnificus"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.0545744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Chonburi Province","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chonburi_Province"},{"name":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_parahaemolyticus"},{"name":"Thulung language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thulung_language"},{"name":"Multiplex polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Chonan languages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chonan_languages"},{"name":"Buri (Germanic tribe)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buri_(Germanic_tribe)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Neuquino People's Movement","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuquino_People's_Movement"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Provinces of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"}]}
