{"id":50214,"title":"Patients referred with type 2 diabetes remain in specialist care for a long period.","abstract":"Patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes are usually managed in general practice. The aim of this study was to describe the duration of contact for patients referred from primary care to a diabetes outpatient clinic.The present study is a retrospective study with follow-up of at least 12 months or until discharged. Risk stratification was performed at referral and when patients were returned to primary care. A total of 154 patients with type 2 diabetes were referred to the clinic in the 2004-2009 period. The main outcome measure was the duration of contact with the diabetes clinic.In all, 105 patients were returned to primary care after a median of ten months (range 1-64 months) and six visits (1-25 visits). Half of the patients were returned to primary care after 18 months, and 20% were still in contact with the diabetes clinic after six years. The majority were classified as high-risk patients with no difference in risk level between patients followed ? 12 or > 12 months.The complication level was high even among discharged patients. The long duration of the contact for the patients who were returned to primary health care should stimulate initiatives leading to a faster course in the secondary care setting.not relevant.not relevant.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814596","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.663995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.600353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Secondary care","weight":0.542246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_care"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.344981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.264782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.149266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
