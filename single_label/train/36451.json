{"id":36451,"title":"Human-induced pluripotent stem cell models of inherited cardiomyopathies.","abstract":"This article provides an overview of the latest advances in in-vitro modeling of inherited cardiomyopathies using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).Inherited cardiomyopathies have been recently modeled by generating iPSCs from patients harboring mutations in genes associated with the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.Patient-specific iPSCs and their differentiated cardiomyocytes (induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) now provide a novel model to study the underlying molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of familial cardiomyopathies as well as for in-vitro drug screening and drug discovery.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576884","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.536216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Pluripotent","weight":0.432535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent"},{"name":"Drug discovery","weight":0.427489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.309291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.271385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.147918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent_stem_cell"}]}
