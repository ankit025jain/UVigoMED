{"id":44959,"title":"Hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for advanced gastric cancer.","abstract":"Laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy has been applied to the treatment of gastric cancer. However, there have been few reports on the laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer, mainly because of the difficulty of the procedure.Here, we report a series of cases where the hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomies with regional lymph node dissection were performed successfully.The average operative time was 245 minutes. The mean blood loss was 110 mL. The number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was beyond 15 nodes satisfying a reliable evaluation of nodal status. All resection specimens had no residual tumor at the proximal or distal resection margins. The mean oral feeding was 3.6 days. The mean postoperative length of stay was 8.7 days.The hand-assisted laparoscopic D2 total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer is both technically feasible and safe.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710226","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.771894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.578891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.313385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.129227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Marion True","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_True"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
