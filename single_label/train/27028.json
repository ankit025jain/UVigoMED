{"id":27028,"title":"[Management of arterial hypertension in the elderly].","abstract":"High blood pressure is very frequent in the elderly; it represents a real threat for the patient's health and a source of huge costs for the economic system. Systolic hypertension is the most frequent form observed in the old, due to large arteries stiffness. Antihypertensive therapy has proven effective to decrease significantly the cardiovascular morbi-mortality and total mortality in this population. A non pharmacological approach is also very useful, but should not be too restrictive. Blood pressure target in patients older than 65 (and, particularly, in octogenarians) is 150/80 mmHg. Blood pressure should be checked in the upright position before changing the drug dosage. The first line therapy in the old should generally be a calcium channel antagonist or a low dose diuretic.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065235","annotations":[{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.878415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.659079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.649962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.194967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Systolic hypertension","weight":0.0804046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_hypertension"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Economic system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system"}]}
