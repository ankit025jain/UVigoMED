{"id":5124,"title":"Cardioprotective effect of aminoguanidine in combination with steroid therapy after blunt chest trauma.","abstract":"Cardiac contusion is an important cause of mortality after blunt chest trauma (BCT). The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the usage of aminoguanidine (AG), in myocardial damage occurring after BCT, alone and in combination with methylprednisolone (MP).Thirty-five female Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 7) including: sham controls (S); only cardiac contusion (CONT); cardiac contusion treated with methylprednisolone (CONT+MP); cardiac contusion treated with aminoguanidine (CONT+AG); and cardiac contusion treated with methylprednisolone and aminoguanidine (CONT+MP+AG). Seven days following the treatments, heart and serum specimens were evaluated histopathologically, immunohistochemically, and biochemically in all groups.Serum AOPP and Tn-I levels increased significantly after cardiac contusions. Haemorrhage, tissue degeneration, and necrosis development was evident following contusions. Increased iNOS expression in myocardial tissue was significantly decreased in the CONT+AG+MP group compared to CONT+AG and CONT+MP groups (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively). The combined treatment of AG and MP increased Bcl-2 expression significantly after contusions compared to the other treatment groups.Combined usage of AG, a selective iNOS inhibitor, with MP, in cardiac contusions, showed a more powerful cardioprotective effect by increasing Bcl-2 expression and reducing iNOS expression (Tab. 3, Fig. 4, Ref. 33).","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318911","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.906247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.776784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.756345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.427379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.317323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"}]}
