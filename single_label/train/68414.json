{"id":68414,"title":"[A combination of solifenacin succinate and naftopidil in the treatment of female overactive bladder].","abstract":"To explore the effective therapy of female overactive bladder unresponsive to behavior training.A total of 67 patients with female overactive bladder unresponsive to behavior training were enrolled from January 2012 to January 2013 at Liaocheng Second People's Hospital. They were randomized into trial and control groups (Iand II). Their mean age was 39.8 (19-57) years. And the mean disease course was 3.8 (1-16) years. The trial group (n = 24) received oral formulations of solifenacin succinate (5 mg, once a day)and naftopidil (25 mg, every evening). The control group I (n = 22) had only solifenacin succinate and the control group II (n = 21) only naftopidil. The treatment lasted for 4 weeks. The time of urination per day, average amount of mona-urination and maximum amount of mona-urination were observed. The changes of all parameters before and after treatment were assessed. And statistic analysis was performed.The urinary urgency score of the trial, control group I and control II groups were 0.8 ± 0.1, 1.8 ± 0.8, 2.1 ± 0.9; and the times of urination per day 9 ± 4, 13 ± 4, 14 ± 5, average amount of mona-urination (295 ± 79), (211 ± 67), (185 ± 64) ml and maximum amount of mona-urination (352 ± 88), (292 ± 75), (235 ± 69) ml respectively. These parameters showed significant differences between the trial and control groups (all P < 0.05).A combination of solifenacin succinate and naftopidil can effectively relieve the symptoms of female overactive bladder and improve the life quality.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521895","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.363097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.235476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Liaocheng","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaocheng"},{"name":"Solifenacin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifenacin"},{"name":"Urinary urgency","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_urgency"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"235","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/235"},{"name":"295","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/295"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"}]}
