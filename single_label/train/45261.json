{"id":45261,"title":"Anticancer activity of novel pyrido[2,3-b]indolizine derivatives: the relevance of phenolic substituents.","abstract":"The potential of indolizine derivatives as anticancer agents has been shown through recent studies. Herein, we present our experimental results, showing that pyrido[2,3-b]indolizine derivatives are effective against colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines.Several pyrido[2,3-b]indolizine derivatives were synthesized and their anticancer potential was evaluated against three CRC cell lines and two normal fibroblast cultures.Our experiments identified 4-(3,4)-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpyrido[2,3-b]indolizine-10-carbonitrile (4f) as being active against all CRC cell lines at concentrations non-cytotoxic against fibroblast cultures. Additionally, cell-cycle analysis indicated that pyrido[2,3-b]indolizines can affect cell-cycle progression, with treated cells accumulating in the S- and G2/M-phase.The hydroxyl groups in both the 3- and 4- positions of the aromatic substituent on C4 of the indolizine nucleus are crucial for activity against CRC cell lines. Further manipulation of the number and position of hydroxyl substituents on the aromatic rings may lead to improved anticancer activity of this class of compounds.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692696","annotations":[{"name":"Pyridine","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyridine"},{"name":"Substituent","weight":0.836891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.796791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Aromaticity","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Phenols","weight":0.51344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenols"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.427305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nitrile","weight":0.420925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrile"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.375715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.159155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Indolizine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indolizine"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"}]}
