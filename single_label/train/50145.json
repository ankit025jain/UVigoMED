{"id":50145,"title":"Thyroid dysfunctions induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","abstract":"Recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have emerged as a new class of anticancer therapy. Although generally considered less toxic than cytotoxic chemotherapy, TKIs do cause significant side effects including fatigue and hypertension. In addition, thyroid dysfunction is a well-known adverse effect of TKI.This review provides a comprehensive assessment of TKI-induced thyroid dysfunctions by sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, vandetanib, axitinib, motesanib and tivozanib. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms that result in this toxicity, the clinical impact of thyroid dysfunction in these patients and the controversies regarding treatment with thyroid hormone (TH) therapy are evaluated.Detection of TKI-induced thyroid dysfunction requires routine monitoring of thyroid function and may necessitate treatment. Potential benefits in developing thyroid dysfunction and potential harm in treating it necessitate controlled studies. Finally, if treatment is pursued, appropriate dosing and timing of TH replacement will require prospective clinical evaluation.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24821006","annotations":[{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.894157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.856309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Thyroid hormone","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Axitinib","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axitinib"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.757185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.731111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.35738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.323286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Vandetanib","weight":0.142371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandetanib"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Thyroid function tests","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_function_tests"},{"name":"Pazopanib","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazopanib"},{"name":"Tyrosine hydroxylase","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
