{"id":9062,"title":"Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunoassay for avian influenza subtype H5 using nanocomposite.","abstract":"We report a novel electrochemical immunosensor that can sensitively detect avian influenza virus H5 subtype (AIV H5) captured by graphene oxide-H5-polychonal antibodies-bovine serum albumin (GO-PAb-BSA) nanocomposite. The graphene oxide (GO) carried H5-polychonal antibody (PAb) were used as signal amplification materials. Upon signal amplification, the immunosensor showed a 256-fold increase in detection sensitivity compared to the immunosensor without GO-PAb-BSA. We designed a PAb labeling GO strategy and signal amplification procedure that allow ultrasensitive and selective detection of AIV H5. The established method responded to 2(-15) HA unit/50 µL H5, with a linear calibration range from 2(-15) to 2(-8) HA unit/50 µL. In summary, we demonstrated that the immunosenser has a high specificity and sensitivity for AIV H5, and the established assay could be potentially applied in the rapid detection of other pathogenic microorganisms.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733043","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.758727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.575314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.566133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.238385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Electrochemistry","weight":0.110913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Graphene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene"},{"name":"Nanocomposite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocomposite"},{"name":"Graphite oxide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_oxide"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Calibration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
