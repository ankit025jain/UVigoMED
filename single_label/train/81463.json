{"id":81463,"title":"Short-term Efficacy of Agents Containing KNO3 or CPP-ACP in Treatment of Dentin Hypersensitivity.","abstract":"To evaluate the short-term efficacy of agents containing KNO3 or casein phosphopeptide- amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity.UltraEZ, containing KNO3 and MI Paste, containing CPP-ACP were applied in this study. The dentin hypersensitivity of 102 subjects was established by a tactile stimulus with a Yeaple preasure probe, and the degree of hypersensitivity was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The patients were divided into four groups: A, B, C and D, using a random number table. UltraEZ, a placebo of UltraEZ, MI Paste, and a placebo of MI Paste were applied to group A, B, C and D respectively for 2 weeks. Dentin hypersensitivity was measured using VAS before the treatment (baseline), on day 2, 7, and 14 during the treatment, and on day 30 and 60 posttreatment.The efficacy of UltraEZ on dentin hypersensitivity was significantly better than that of the corresponding placebo group on day 7 during the treatment, whereas the efficacy of MI Paste exhibited better than that of the placebo group on day 14 during the treatment. However, there were no differences between the efficacy of the two agents on day 14 during the treatment, day 30 or day 60 posttreatment.Both UltraEZ and MI Paste had a significant effect on dentin hypersensitivity. UltraEZ showed quicker effects than MI Paste, but MI Paste had a greater sustained action after treatment than UltraEZ.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028689","annotations":[{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.733472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.591466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.546141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Casein","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Amorphous solid","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Random number table","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_table"},{"name":"Paste (magazine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paste_(magazine)"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"2011 Australian Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open"},{"name":"Amorphous calcium phosphate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_calcium_phosphate"}]}
