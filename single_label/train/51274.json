{"id":51274,"title":"Continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion in type 1 diabetes: a 6-year post-trial follow-up.","abstract":"Continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) with an implantable pump is a treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Aim of the present study was to describe the long-term course of glycaemic control, complications, health related quality of life (HRQOL) and treatment satisfaction among T1DM patients treated with CIPII.Nineteen patients that participated in a randomized cross-over trial comparing CIPII and subcutaneous (SC) therapy in 2006 were followed until 2012. Laboratory, continuous glucose monitoring, HRQOL and treatment satisfaction measurements were performed at the start of the study, the end of the SC-, the end of the CIPII treatment phase in 2006 and during CIPII therapy in 2012. Linear mixed models were used to calculate estimated values and to test differences between the moments in time.In 2012, more time was spent in hyperglycaemia than after the CIPII treatment phase in 2006: 37% (95% CI 29, 44) vs. 55% (95% CI 48, 63), mean difference 19.8% (95% CI 3.0, 36.6). HbA1c was 65 mmol/mol (95% CI 60, 71) at the end of the SC treatment phase in 2006, 58 mmol/mol (95% CI 53, 64) at the end of the CIPII treatment phase and 65 mmol/mol (95% CI 60, 71) in 2012, respectively (p?>?0.05). In 2012, the median number of grade 2 hypoglycaemic events per week (1 (95% CI 0, 2)) was still significantly lower than during prior SC therapy (3 (95% CI 2, 4)): mean change -1.8 (95% CI -3.4, -0.4). Treatment satisfaction with CIPII was better than with SC insulin therapy and HRQOL remained stable. Pump or catheter dysfunction of the necessitated re-operation in 7 patients. No mortality was reported.After 6 years of CIPII treatment, glycaemic regulation is stable and the number of hypoglycaemic events decreased compared to SC insulin therapy. Treatment satisfaction with CIPII is superior to SC insulin therapy, HRQOL is stable and complications are scarce. CIPII is a safe and effective treatment option for selected patients with T1DM, also on longer term.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Endocrine System
