{"id":82285,"title":"Efficacy of red and infrared lasers in treatment of temporomandibular disorders--a double-blind, randomized, parallel clinical trial.","abstract":"Low-level laser therapy has still not been well established, and it is important to define a standardized protocol for the treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) using low level laser. There is no consensus on controlled clinical trials concerning the best option for laser therapy with regard to wavelength. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of red and infrared laser therapy in patients with TMD, using a randomized parallel-group double-blind trial.Each hemiface of 19 subjects was randomized to receive intervention, in a total of 116 sensitive points. Pain was measured at baseline and time intervals of 24 hours, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days after treatment. Irradiation of 4 J/cm2 in the temporomandibular joints and 8 J/cm(2) in the muscles was used in three sessions.Both treatments had statistically significant results (P<0.001); there was statistical difference between them at 180 days in favor of the infrared laser (P=0.039). There was improvement in 24 hours, which extended up to 180 days in both groups.Both lasers are effective in the treatment and remission of TMD symptoms.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660647","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.662155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.488113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.431707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Low level laser therapy","weight":0.321729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_level_laser_therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.225096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.167082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
