{"id":9796,"title":"Elevated brain monoamine oxidase activity in SIV- and HIV-associated neurological disease.","abstract":"We recently demonstrated direct evidence of increased monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in the brain of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease, consistent with previously reported dopamine deficits in both SIV and HIV infection. In this study, we explored potential mechanisms behind this elevated activity. MAO B messenger RNA was highest in macaques with the most severe SIV-associated CNS lesions and was positively correlated with levels of CD68 and GFAP transcripts in the striatum. MAO B messenger RNA also correlated with viral loads in the CNS of SIV-infected macaques and with oxidative stress. Furthermore, in humans, striatal MAO activity was elevated in individuals with HIV encephalitis, compared with activity in HIV-seronegative controls. These data suggest that the neuroinflammation and oxidative stress caused by SIV infection in the CNS may provide the impetus for increased transcription of MAO B and that MAO, and more broadly, oxidative stress, have significant potential as therapeutic targets in CNS disease due to HIV.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24688074","annotations":[{"name":"Simian immunodeficiency virus","weight":0.917219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.796988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Glial fibrillary acidic protein","weight":0.712357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glial_fibrillary_acidic_protein"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Monoamine oxidase","weight":0.683731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase"},{"name":"Simian","weight":0.652351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Monoamine neurotransmitter","weight":0.472176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
