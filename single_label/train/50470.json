{"id":50470,"title":"Thyroid stimulating hormone assay as the first line biochemical parameter to determine thyroid gland abnormalities.","abstract":"Increased cellular catabolic activities observed in hyperthyroid state had been established. This is consequent to excessive hormones secreted by the thyroid gland during this condition. A total of 60 subjects comprising of 45 females mean age 43.02 +/- 1.90 (range 22-70 years) and 15 males mean age 50.40 +/- 3.59 (range 25-68) and 60 controls comprising of 45 females mean age 41.18 +/- 1.68 (range 22-68 years) and 15 males mean age 40.53 +/- 2.88 (range 25-65) were recruited for the study. The plasma level of T4, T3 and TSH were determined in both the experiment group and the controls. A significant increase (p < 0.05) in plasma T4, T3 and a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in plasma TSH were observed in the experiment group in comparison to the controls. Also, an inverse relationship was noted to exist between the plasma T4 and T3; and TSH in primary hyperthyroid state.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783789","annotations":[{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.724397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.447222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.369577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.243229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.030717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"23rd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_century_BC"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Consequent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
