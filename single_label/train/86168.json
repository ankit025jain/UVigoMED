{"id":86168,"title":"Mass and fat infiltration of intercostal muscles measured by CT histogram analysis and their correlations with COPD severity.","abstract":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive respiratory function impairment and respiratory muscle dysfunction. We hypothesized that the mass and fat infiltration of respiratory muscles correlates with COPD severity and emphysema extent.Ninety-eight male patients with COPD underwent chest computed tomography (CT) and spirometry. The mass and fat infiltrations of intercostal and latissimus muscles were quantified as the cross-sectional area (CSA) and attenuation of these muscles using CT histogram analysis. Intercostal index and latissimus index were defined as intercostal CSAs and latissimus CSAs divided by body mass index. The emphysema extent was measured as the ratio of the emphysematous lung volume to the total lung volume using a density-mask technique. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between these parameters. Multiple regression analysis was performed using forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) as the dependent parameter and the clinical and CT data as the independent parameters.FEV1 was significantly correlated with intercostal index (r = 0.57), latissimus index (r = 0.34), intercostal attenuation (r = 0.62), and latissimus attenuation (r = 0.38). Emphysema extent was significantly correlated with intercostal index (r = -0.36) and intercostal attenuation (r = -0.50). Multiple regression analysis showed that FEV1 was predicted by intercostal attenuation (B = 0.40), intercostal CSA (B = 0.23), emphysema extent (B = -0.23), and age (B = -0.21, R(2) = 0.64, P < .001).A decrease in intercostal mass and an increase in intercostal fat are associated with worsening of COPD severity.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809313","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Lung volumes","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_volumes"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.334377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.290784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.114166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Latissimus dorsi muscle","weight":0.0362205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latissimus_dorsi_muscle"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
