{"id":34226,"title":"A nationwide survey on Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome in Japan.","abstract":"Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterized by the tetralogy of cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, and progressive muscle weakness due to myopathy. MSS is extremely rare, and its clinical, pathological, and genetic features are not yet fully understood.We conducted a nationwide, questionnaire-based survey on MSS in Japan and carefully reviewed the medical records of 36 patients suspected of having this disease. In addition, pathological examinations of muscles, sequence and haplotype analysis in SIL1 were performed.The patients had been examined between the ages of 2 and 52 years. Delayed psychomotor development and cataracts from early childhood were observed in all patients, whereas no life-threatening events were observed. Mutations in SIL1 were identified in 24 of the 27 patients tested, and 43 of the 48 chromosomes possessed the SIL1 c.936dupG (p.Leu313fs) mutation. The haplotype analysis revealed that 31 of the 32 chromosomes (96.9%) with the c.936dupG mutation had the same haplotype.The results of haplotype analysis suggested the presence of a founder effect. The clinical features of patients without SIL1 mutations were indistinguishable from those with SIL1 mutations, suggesting the genetic heterogeneity of MSS.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755310","annotations":[{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.811935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.691357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.673523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.642728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Founder effect","weight":0.627383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.451707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Leucine","weight":0.441381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.312037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.127611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Demonic possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"}]}
