{"id":66900,"title":"Acute kidney injury with medazepam-hyoscine buthylbromide.","abstract":"An 84-year-old female patient was admitted to our internal medicine outpatient clinic complaining of stomach ache, nausea, and vomiting. She had hepatitis C infection for 10 years that was managed with antiviral treatment. On the second day of admission, she developed anxiety and complained about dysuria. Medazepam and hyoscine butylbromide combined tablet was administered. The day after medazepam and hyoscine butylbromide administration, patient's creatinine level increased to 2.3 mg/dL (0.57-1.11 mg/dL). Medazepam and hyoscine butylbromide administration was stopped on the fourth day. After 10 days of follow-up, her creatinine levels were normalized. In this article, we present an elderly patient with acute kidney injury induced by medazepam and hyoscine butylbromide that was managed with best supportive care.
