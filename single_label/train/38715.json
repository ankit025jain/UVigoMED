{"id":38715,"title":"Perventricular device closure of a large residual perimembranous interventricular septal defect after previous surgical correction.","abstract":"A 21 years albanian patient was referred with important residual left to right shunt. He was undergone 7 years before conventional surgical correction of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD). The patient underwent sternotomy and perventricular device closure of the residual employing a 16Â mm multifenestrated atrial septal defect occlude, which was positioned through the anterior wall of the right ventricle. across the defect. The previous autologous pericardial patch was compressed into the double umbrella device. We may conclude that perventricular device closure can employed successfully in patients with residual perimembranous VSD after previous surgical repair as an alternative to the conventional surgery with excellent hemodynamic and postoperative outcome. Such a technique should be part of the surgical armamentarum.
