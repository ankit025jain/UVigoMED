{"id":66910,"title":"Hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype and chronic kidney disease in a Chinese population aged 40 years and older.","abstract":"To examine the relationship between the HW phenotype and risk for CKD in a community population aged 40 years and older.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Zhuhai from June to October 2012. The participants were divided into three groups: Group 1, Waist circumference >90 cm in men or >85 cm in women and triglycerides ?2 mmol/l; Group 3, Waist circumference ?90 cm in men or ?85 cm in women and triglycerides <2 mmol/l; Group 2, The remaining participants. The prevalence of the three subgroups and CKD were determined. The association between HW phenotype and CKD was then analyzed using SPSS (version 13.0).After adjusting for age and sex, Group 1 was associated with CKD (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.01, 4.73, P<0.001), when compared with Group 3. Further adjustment for factors which were potential confounders and unlikely to be in the causal pathway between the HW phenotype and CKD, Group 1 was still significantly associated with CKD. The OR for CKD was 2.65 (95% CI 1.65, 4.26, P<0.001). When adjusted for diabetes and hypertension, the association of Group 1 and CKD was still significant (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.26, 3.45, P?=?0.004). Group 2 was associated with CKD (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.29, 2.53, P?=?0.001), when compared with Group 3. Further adjustment for factors which were potential confounders, Group 2 was still significantly associated with CKD. The OR for CKD was 1.75 (95% CI 1.22, 2.51, P?=?0.002). When adjusted for diabetes and hypertension, the association between Group 2 and CKD still existed. The OR for CKD was 1.48 (95% CI 1.01, 2.16, P?=?0.046).Our results showed that HW phenotype was associated with CKD in the population aged 40 years and older.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24663403","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.766946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"China","weight":0.364223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.334585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.251998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0797502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Zhuhai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Heavyweight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"The Strip (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strip_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
