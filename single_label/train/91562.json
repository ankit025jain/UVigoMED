{"id":91562,"title":"Total knee replacement in a dog with a non-union type B3 tibial plateau fracture.","abstract":"A six-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer was presented with a 12 month history of left pelvic limb lameness following trauma. Clinical examination revealed marked thickening and reduced range-of-motion of the left stifle and radiographs were suggestive of a non-union type B3 tibial plateau fracture with severe secondary osteoarthritis. Total knee replacement was performed with adjunctive stabilization of the proximal tibial fracture fragment. Clinical follow-up at six and 12 months with quantitative gait analysis revealed significant improvement in limb function.
