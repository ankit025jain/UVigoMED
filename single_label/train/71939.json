{"id":71939,"title":"[Adaptive response of cancer cells to metabolic stress].","abstract":"In general, cancer cells proliferate depending on glycolysis, whereas supply of glucose and other nutrients is not always sufficient. Therefore, cancer cells can be often exposed to intracellular energy and/or nutrient imbalance and various forms of stress that is associated with energetic insufficiency. To cope with such metabolic stresses, cells have various mechanisms to sense nutrient status and to adapt stressful cell conditions. These include the nutrient-signaling pathways that are regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and also the cellular stress responses, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses as well as autophagy.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016804","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"AMP-activated protein kinase","weight":0.866625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.828671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.571418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.156906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"}]}
