{"id":87306,"title":"[Peculiarities of the driver's position in cars of various types influencing biomechanics of body movements in the case of emergency break application].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to determine the mean angles between different body segments of the car drivers depending on their position in various types of the vehicles (\"sedan\", \"crossover\", \"minivan\") at the moment immediately preceding emergency break application. The study was based on the experimental data obtained with the participation of volunteers and the results of simulation. These materials were treated with the use of the arithmetic mean, mean square deviation, and mean error. The rank correlation method was employed. The significance of the difference between the quantities of interest was estimated with the use of Student's t-table. The angles between different body segments of the car drivers depending on their position in various types of the vehicles (\"sedan\", \"crossover\", \"minivan\") were measured. The data obtained confirm that peculiarities of the driver's position in the car determine the mechanisms of the injuries related to a car incident.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275179","annotations":[{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.873279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.324023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.214558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Arithmetic","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Minivan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minivan"},{"name":"Sedan (automobile)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Rank (linear algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Loudspeaker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Rank correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_correlation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Experimental data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_data"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
