{"id":81783,"title":"Orthodontic and surgical perspectives in management of a severe skeletal open bite.","abstract":"In orthognathic correction of skeletal discrepancy, different treatment options should be considered to give optimum results to the patient with minimal postoperative problems caused by extensive bi-jaw surgery. In a case of severe vertical dysplasia with a large open bite, the orthodontist with the help of advanced diagnostic tools such as imaging software had planned bi-jaw surgery. However, there was a difference in opinion with the oral surgeon who considered only single jaw surgery to get adequate results. The possibility of only maxillary Le Fort I surgery creating autorotation of the mandible was considered, as 0.5° of autorotation results with 1° of maxillary posterior segment clockwise rotation thus avoiding bi-jaw surgery. After performing the Le Fort I superior repositioning of maxilla, the mandibular autorotation was not adequate, so a mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) for mandibular advancement had to be performed to achieve favourable results.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835800","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.799944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.794772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.723581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.639426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Oral surgery","weight":0.466646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_surgery"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.458261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.330791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.315453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.242404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Autorotation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorotation"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Open bite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Rattlesnake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattlesnake"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"List of neuroimaging software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neuroimaging_software"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Clockwise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise"}]}
