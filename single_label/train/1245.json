{"id":1245,"title":"[Portable ultrasound devices: a novel bedside approach for diagnosing cardiovascular disease].","abstract":"Bedside cardiovascular diagnosis by examination, palpation and auscultation is sub-optimal, even when performed by experts. While the diagnostic accuracy of imaging techniques is superior to physical examination, the feasibility of its integration into bedside examination has been precluded by the size and cost of imaging technology. Beyond these practical limitations, expertise in image acquisition and assessment is required. Nonetheless, these problems could be resolved by a low cost, easy to use, portable imaging device that could be used routinely at the bedside. Small, high-resolution cardiac ultrasound units have been developed. Published studies have demonstrated a remarkable increase in the accuracy of cardiovascular diagnosis by cardiologists and non-cardiologists when they added a brief cardiac ultrasound study to their conventional physical examination. This new diagnostic methodology is becoming common practice among cardiologists and non- cardiologists. As its use is becoming more popular, several factors must be resolved, such as: Which personnel may use it? Is the training necessary or compulsory? Which entities are responsible for training and continuous education? decisions regarding documentation, of findings and exams, and more. In this review, we will provide the latest literature updates and discuss whether there is enough evidence to justify the use of ultrasound mobile devices for a focused ultrasound examination to complement the traditional physical examination.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417491","annotations":[{"name":"Auscultation","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultation"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.729365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.669954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.575714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.411784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.337213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.127314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"High-intensity focused ultrasound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_focused_ultrasound"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
