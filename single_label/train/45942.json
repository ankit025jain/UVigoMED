{"id":45942,"title":"Serum ferritin concentration predicts mortality in patients with hepatitis B virus-related acute on chronic liver failure.","abstract":"This study was designed to investigate the association between serum ferritin concentration (SF) and hepatitis B virus infected patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF). In addition, we analyzed whether SF levels are associated with mortality in AoCLF patients.One hundred and seventeen patients, including 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 71 with AoCLF, and 55 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. All patients were followed for 4 months. In all subjects, a blood sample was collected at admission to examine liver function, renal function, international normalized ratio, and SF levels. A total of six clinical chemistry and biochemical variables (e.g., model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score, age, levels of SF, total protein, albumin, and alanine aminotransferase) were measured and analyzed for their association with outcomes by using Cox proportional hazards and multiple regression models.AoCLF patients had significantly higher SF levels at admission compared to HCs and CHB (all p = 0.001). Elevated SF levels were associated with increased severity of liver disease and 3-month mortality rate. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SF levels and MELD score were independent predictors for mortality (both p <0.001).The SF measured at admission may serve as an independent predictor for 3-month mortality rate in AoCLF patients.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656903","annotations":[{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.844295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical chemistry","weight":0.732136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.626178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.559079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.55096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.474958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.319913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"}]}
