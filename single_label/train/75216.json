{"id":75216,"title":"[Ecological executive function characteristics and effects of executive function on quality of life in young adult epileptics].","abstract":"To explore the characteristics of ecological executive function in young adults with idiopathic or probably symptomatic epilepsy and examine the effects of executive function on quality of life.Fifty-five epileptics (EP) and 39 matched healthy controls (HC) aged 18-44 years at our hospital were selected. The differences in ecological executive function and quality of life were compared between two groups with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-adult version (BRIEF-A) and QOLIE-31.Comparing with controls, the epileptics yielded higher scores significantly on most subscales of BRIEF-A (P < 0.05), including total score [(55 ± 9) vs (48 ± 7)], inhibition [(54 ± 7) vs (48 ± 7)], emotion control [(56 ± 8) vs (49 ± 7)], self-monitor [(54 ± 10) vs (47 ± 7)], initiation [(51 ± 10) vs (46 ± 9)], working memory [(56 ± 10) vs (50 ± 9)], planning [(53 ± 10) vs (47 ± 7)], behavioral regulation index (BRI) and metacognition index (MI). Pearson's correlation test showed that the total score of QOLIE-31 had significantly negative correlations with the scores of BRIEF-A, such as global executive composite (GEC), behavioral regulation index (BRI), metacogniton index (MI), inhibition, emotional control, monitoring, initiation and working memory (r = -0.284- -0.457, P < 0.05). Moreover, seizure control and seizure type were also related with the total score of QOLIE-31(r = -0.302, r = 0.268, P < 0.05). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that emotional control in BRIEF-A was related with seizure worry and cognitive function in QOLIE-31(t = -2.137, t = -2.427, P < 0.05) . Behavioral regulation index (BRI) was closely related with emotional well-being in QOLIE-31(t = -2.148, P < 0.05). Also, working memory was related with cognitive function, overall quality of life and total score in QOLIE-31(t = -3.138, -3.564, -2.948, P < 0.05). And inhibition was related with energy, social function and total score in QOLIE-31(t = -3.007, -3.580, -2.191, P < 0.05).Young adults with idiopathic or probably symptomatic epilepsy may have significant executive function impairment. The aspects of emotional control, BRI, working memory and inhibition in ecological executive function are significantly related with quality of life in epilepsy.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Nervous System
