{"id":26061,"title":"[Socio-demographic differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases among women and men in Poland--results from the Courage in Europe Project].","abstract":"The aim of the study was to assess differences in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (hypertension, coronary artery disease - CAD, stroke) in women and men in relation to demographic and social characteristics in adult population in Poland. Study was performed in the representative group of 4071 individuals (18+) in Poland. Face to face interviews were done using structured questionnaire. Chi-squared test and decision tree analysis have been used to assess the presence of difference between groups and to determine characteristics typical for the ill. Age was a factor significantly associated with the diversity of CVD prevalence in women and men. Similar role played the level of education and marital status. Low income was additional significant determinant of the CVD for both women and men. Analysis based on decision trees additionally confirmed the differences in characteristics of ill persons in younger age groups. Our results indicate that especially in younger age groups it may be more than expected number of women suffering from early stage ischemic heart disease. Due to atypical or less severe symptoms some cases remain probably undiagnosed on the level of health care system. Our finding is supported by the consistency between the frequency of physician diagnosed CAD and WHO algorithm in 60-79 age category.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154206","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.733987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.558725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.519526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.460249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.439447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.36009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.27492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Canadian dollar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Courage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage"}]}
