{"id":59449,"title":"[Gynecological malignant tumor related multiple primary malignant neoplasms: clinical analysis of 30 cases].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical features of gynecological malignant tumor related multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMN).Apply retrospective and comprehensive analysis to the clinical data of 30 patients with gynecological malignant tumor related MPMN.Synchronous MPMN were found in 9 patients. Their average age was 50.2 years old and their median age was 49 years old. The neoplasms were located at ovary, uterus, cervix, breast and intestine. Metachronous MPMN were found in 21 patients. Their average age was 57.7 and their median age was 57 years old. The median interval between the first and the second primary malignant neoplasm was 4.0 years. The neoplasms were located at breast, ovary, uterus, gastrointestinal tract, uterine cervix, lung etc. In 30 cases, 26 of them were treated by surgical operation and further adjunctive treatment of chemotherapy and (or) radiotherapy was conducted as per the neoplasm staging and its pathological results. The rest 4 patients (first primary malignant neoplasms were excised from 3 of them and another one was not treated by surgical operation) received adjunctive treatment of chemotherapy and (or) radiotherapy. Followed ups, which varied from 6 to 60 months, were made to 29 patients and 20 out of the 29 were alive.5-year survival rate of patients with gynecological malignant tumor related MPMN was 47.8%, 2-year survival rate was 73.9%, and 1-year survival rate was 88.6%.Pay more attention to the patients with gynecological malignant tumor related MPMN, examine the high-risk patients with malignant tumor comprehensively, identify whether it is recurrence, metastasis or new growth of malignant neoplasm, and further ensure early diagnosis and proper treatment, avoiding misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820305","annotations":[{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.858506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.725652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.572164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.458524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
