{"id":45587,"title":"Step-by-step esophagojejunal anastomosis after intra-corporeal total gastrectomy for laparoscopic gastric cancer treatment: technique of \"reverse anvil\".","abstract":"The laparoscopic gastrectomy is a relatively new procedure due mainly to the difficulties related to lymphadenectomy and reconstruction. Until the moment, technique or device to perform the esophagojejunal anastomosis by laparoscopy is still a challenge. So, a safe, cheap and quickly performing technique is desirable to be developed.To present technique proposed by the authors with its technical details on reconstruction with \"reverse anvil\".After total gastrectomy completed intra-corporeally, the reconstruction starts with the preparation of the intra-abdominal esophagus cross-section next to the esophagogastric transition of 50%. A graduated device is prepared using Levine gastric tubes (nº. 14 and 10), 3 cm length, connected to the anvil of the circular stapler (nº. 25) with a wire thread (2-0 or 3-0) of 10 cm, which is connected to end of this device. The whole device is introduced in reverse esophagus. The esophagus is amputated and the wire is pulled after previous transfixation in the distal esophagus and the anvil positioned. The jejunal loop is sectioned 20-30 cm from duodenojejunal angle, and the anvil put in the jejunal loop and connect previously in the esophagus. Linear stapler (blue 60 mm) is used to close the opening of the jejunal loop.The \"reverse anvil\" technique used by the authors facilitated the transit reestablishment after total gastrectomy, contributing to obviate reconstruction problems after total gastrectomy.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676304","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.793433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.675266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.656402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.652627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.617515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.545467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Anvil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Starting pitcher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Involuntary commitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment"},{"name":"Yarn","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn"},{"name":"Stapler","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapler"}]}
