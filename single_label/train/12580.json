{"id":12580,"title":"Chrysin reduced acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo assessments.","abstract":"Acrylamide (ACR) is a well-known industrial toxic chemical that produces neurotoxicity, which is characterized by progressive central and peripheral neuronal degeneration. Chrysin is a natural, biologically active flavonoid compound, which is commonly found in many plants. The antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of chrysin have been demonstrated.In this study, the possible effect of chrysin on ACR-induced toxicity was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. PC12 cells were used as a suitable in vitro model. Cells were exposed to chrysin (0.5-5 µM) for 12 and 24 h, and then ACR in IC50 concentration was added to the cells. Finally, cell viability was determined using (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium assay. For in vivo assay, Wistar rats were treated with ACR (50 mg/kg i.p. for 11 days) alone or in combination with chrysin (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg). At the end of treatment, behavioral index was evaluated.ACR decreased cell viability and pre-treatment with chrysin (0.5-5 µM) significantly decreased ACR-induced cytotoxicity in the time- and dose-dependent manner. In Wistar rats, exposure to ACR significantly induced severe gait abnormalities, but treatment with chrysin (50 mg/kg) reduced ACR-induced neurotoxicity in animals.In the current study, chrysin exhibited neuroprotective effect on PC12 cells as an in vitro model and also on Wistar rats.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518551","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.789517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.705739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.631032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.533835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.46771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Acrylamide","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"PC12 cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC12_cell"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Toxic waste","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_waste"},{"name":"Biphenyl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphenyl"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
