{"id":44273,"title":"Identification of miRNAs differentially expressed in clinical stages of human colorectal carcinoma-an investigation in Guangzhou, China.","abstract":"Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in human cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Such dysregulated miRNAs may have potential as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets. However, the nature of an association between these miRNAs and clinical stages of CRC is still not clear. To this end, we performed a miRNA profiling of 1547 distinct human miRNAs using 31 samples of tumor and paired normal mucosa obtained from 31 CRC patients. Based on statistical analyses of profiling data, we identified 569 miRNAs that were significantly dysregulated in CRC relative to normal tissues (P<0.05). Among the 569 dysregulated miRNAs, downregulation of 17 was associated with stages II, III, and IV colon and rectal cancers (separate or combined), according to our criteria. We also assessed the potential of these dysregulated miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for CRC patients who were without metastasis, and the value of the dysregulated miRNAs for predicting metastasis, lymph node and distant. Their distinct expression patterns in colon and rectal cancers were also examined. Although our findings cannot be immediately applied toward clinical diagnosis, our new study model for determining and assessing the biomarker potential of dysregulated miRNAs should be useful in further research in detection of human CRC.
