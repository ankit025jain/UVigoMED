{"id":28436,"title":"Non-employment histories of middle-aged men and women who died from alcohol-related causes: a longitudinal retrospective study.","abstract":"Long-term patterning of non-employment among problem drinkers is poorly understood. We determined the level and timing of non-employment, and the relative contribution of various types of non-employment among middle-aged persons who died of alcohol-related causes.We conducted a longitudinal retrospective register-based study of Finnish men and women aged 45-64 years who died of alcohol-related causes (n?=?15,552) or other causes (n?=?39,166) in the period 2000-07, or who survived (n?=?204,422) until the end of 2007. We traced back the number of days in employment and non-employment for up to 17 years before death or before the end of the study period for the survivors.The majority (?56%) of persons who died of alcohol-related causes were in employment up to ten years before death. Over the 17-year period before death, those who died of alcohol-related causes were in employment on average two years less (mean 6.3 years, 95%CI 6.2-6.4) than those dying of other causes (8.2, 8.1-8.3), and five years less than survivors (11.6, 11.5-11.7), when sex and age were adjusted for. The relative role of various types of non-employment differed markedly across the two mortality groups. Among those who died of alcohol-related causes, unemployment accounted for 54% of the total burden of non-employment, in comparison with 29% among those who died of other causes. In contrast, disability pension accounted for 41% of the total burden of non-employment among those who died of alcohol-related causes, but 65% among those who died of other causes.The results indicate the feasibility of preventing movement out of employment among middle-aged men and women with severe alcohol-related harm, provided that they are identified early on during their working careers and offered effective interventions.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874518","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.560586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.558923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Pension","weight":0.507473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Disability pension","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_pension"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pattern formation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_formation"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
