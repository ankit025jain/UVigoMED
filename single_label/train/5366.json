{"id":5366,"title":"[Effect of paeoniflorin on level of glucocorticoid receptor of peripheral blood monocytes in rats of collagen-induced arthritis].","abstract":"The study is to explore the effect of paeoniflorin on the level of glucocorticoid receptor, including glucocorticoid receptor-alpha (GCRalpha) and glucocorticoid receptor-beta (GCRbeta), of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in rats of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA is induced in Wistar rats by an intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen emulsified with complete adjuvant. From the 14th day after primary immunization, the CIA rats were intragastrically administered paeoniflorin 25, 50 and 100 mg x kg(-1) or triptolde 20 microg x kg(-1) or paeoniflorin 50 mg x kg(-1) + RU486 15 mg x kg(-1), once a day, for 28 consecutive days. After administration, apart from PF + RU486 group all experimental rats were took blood by removalling eyeball, then separated PBMCs. The level of GCRalpha, GCRbeta in PBMCs were examined by ELISA, and the mRNA expression of GCRalpha, GCRbeta was detected by RT-PCR. All rats were sacrificed and took the joint with no immunization. The expression of IL-1beta, NF-kappaB p65, TNF-alpha, PGE2 of synovial tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. Paeoniflorin was able to inhibit the expression of IL-1beta, NF-kappaB p65, TNF-alpha, PGE2 of synovial tissue in CIA rats. While RU486, glucocorticoid receptor's blocker, could weaken the fuction of paeoniflorin. Meanwhile, paeoniflorin obviously induced the expression of GCRalpha and GCRalpha mRNA, while obviously inhibited the expression of GCRbeta and GCRbeta mRNA. These results indicat paeoniflorine suppresses inflammatory mediator production may be relating with it regulating GCR in PBMCs of CIA rats.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204188","annotations":[{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.920316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.725994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.626826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Mifepristone","weight":0.585569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.537137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.385582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Type-II collagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-II_collagen"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid receptor","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid_receptor"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"}]}
