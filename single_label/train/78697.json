{"id":78697,"title":"A functional Ser326Cys polymorphism in hOGG1 is associated with noise-induced hearing loss in a Chinese population.","abstract":"DNA damage to cochlear hair cells caused by 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is essential for the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Human 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase1 (hOGG1) is a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway that eliminates 8-oxoG. Many epidemiological and functional studies have suggested that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism (rs1052133) is associated with many diseases. The purpose of this investigation was to investigate whether the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in the human BER pathway is associated with genetic susceptibility to NIHL in a Chinese population. This polymorphism was genotyped among 612 workers with NIHL and 615 workers with normal hearing. We found that individuals with the hOGG1 Cys/Cys genotype had a statistically significantly increased risk of NIHL compared with those who carried the hOGG1 Ser/Ser genotype (adjusted OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.13-2.25) and this increased risk was more pronounced among the workers in the 15- to 25- and >25-year noise exposure time, 85-92 dB(A) noise exposure level, ever smoking, and ever drinking groups, similar effects were also observed in a recessive model. In summary, our data suggested that the hOGG1 Cys/Cys genotype may be a genetic susceptibility marker for NIHL in the Chinese Han population.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599382","annotations":[{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.82683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.75226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.62732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.495559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.491223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.484022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.420543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"China","weight":0.373798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.211916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.186716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.160274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Excision repair","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excision_repair"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"DNA glycosylase","weight":0.127295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_glycosylase"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.120698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Base excision repair","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Hair cell","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_cell"}]}
