{"id":30819,"title":"The validity of the Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Symptom Screener (SAMISS) in people living with HIV/AIDS in primary HIV care in Cape Town, South Africa.","abstract":"Given the high prevalence of HIV in South Africa and co-morbid mental disorders in people living with HIV/AIDs (PLWHA) we sought to validate a brief screening tool in primary HIV care.366 PLWHA were recruited prior to combination anti-retroviral treatment (CART) initiation from two primary health HIV clinics. A mental health nurse administered a socio-demographic questionnaire and the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and a lay counsellor administered the Substance and Mental Illness Symptom Screener (SAMISS).Using the MINI, 17 % of participants were identified with either depression, anxiety disorders or adjustment disorder and 18 % with substance or alcohol abuse/dependence. The sensitivity and specificity of the SAMISS was 94 % (95 % CI: 88-98 %) and 58 % (95 % CI: 52-65 %) respectively, with the alcohol component (sensitivity: 94 %; specificity: 85 %) performing better than the mental illness component of the SAMISS (sensitivity: 97 %; specificity: 60 %). The specificity of the tool improved when the cut-off for the mental illness component was increased.The SAMISS may provide a useful first tier screening tool for common mental disorders in primary care for PLWHA.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452497","annotations":[{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Adjustment disorder","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustment_disorder"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.752754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.689554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.664861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.406273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.339074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.241581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cape Town","weight":0.127937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0653277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Licensed Professional Counselor","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensed_Professional_Counselor"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"HIV-positive people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive_people"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS in South Africa","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
