{"id":81535,"title":"Vertical ridge augmentation using xenogenous bone blocks: a comparison between the flap and tunneling procedures.","abstract":"Previous studies have shown that the subperiosteal tunneling procedure in vertical ridge augmentation accelerates healing after grafting and prevents graft exposure, with minor postoperative complications. It is conceivable that new bone formation would be greater with the tunneling procedure than with the flap procedure, because the former is minimally invasive. This hypothesis was tested in this study by comparing new bone formation between the flap and tunneling procedures after vertical ridge augmentation using xenogenous bone blocks in a canine mandible model.Two Bio-Oss blocks were placed on the edentulous ridge in each side of the mandibles of 6 mongrel dogs. The blocks in each side were randomly assigned to grafting with a flap procedure (flap group) or grafting with a tunneling procedure (tunneling group).The mean percentage of newly formed bone within the block was 15.3 ± 6.6% in the flap group and 46.6 ± 23.4% in the tunneling group.Based on data presented in this study, when a tunneling procedure is used to place xenogenous bone blocks for vertical ridge augmentation, bone formation in the graft sites is significantly greater than when a flap procedure is used.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24985960","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.650516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.54175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Quantum tunnelling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
