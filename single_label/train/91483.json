{"id":91483,"title":"Nerve growth factor modulation of retinal ganglion cell physiology.","abstract":"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is an endogenous neurotrophin involved in the development, maintenance and regeneration of mammalian sympathetic and sensory neurons. Additionally, NGF is known to have trophic and differentiating activity on several populations of cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), and to act as a differentiation factor in the development of the visual cortex. The paramount functions of NGF in the visual system are also highlighted by the presence of this neurotrophin and both its receptors TrkA and p75 in most intra-ocular tissues, including lens, vitreous, choroid, iris, and trabecular meshwork. In the retina, NGF is produced and utilized specifically by retinal ganglion cells (RGC), bipolar neurons and glial cells, and is thought to have crucial protective effects in several disease states. Studies on the role of NGF on RGCs survival following optic nerve transection, ischemic injury, ocular hypertension and glaucoma are discussed in this review.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds
