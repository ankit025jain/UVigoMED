{"id":28771,"title":"Chemotherapy-induced hand-foot syndrome and nail changes: a review of clinical presentation, etiology, pathogenesis, and management.","abstract":"Chemotherapy-induced hand-foot syndrome and nail changes are common complications of many classic chemotherapeutic agents and the newer molecular targeted therapies. They significantly impact patient quality of life, and frequently necessitate chemotherapy dose intensity modification or reduction. We aim to describe the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and current evidence-based treatment options for these entities.
