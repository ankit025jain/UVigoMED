{"id":61907,"title":"Anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies in patients with impaired graft function after liver transplantation.","abstract":"Heparin, the standard perioperative anticoagulant for the prevention of graft vessel thrombosis in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT), binds to the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4). Antibodies that are formed against the resulting PF4/heparin complexes can induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. LT is a clinical situation that allows the study of T-cell dependency of immune responses because T-cell function is largely suppressed pharmacologically in these patients to prevent graft rejection.To investigate the immune response against PF4/heparin complexes in patients undergoing LT.In this prospective cohort study, 38 consecutive patients undergoing LT were systematically screened for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies (enzyme immunoassay and heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay), platelet count, liver function, and engraftment.At baseline, 5 (13%) of 38 patients tested positive for anti-PF4/heparin IgG (non-platelet-activating) antibodies. By day 20, an additional 5 (15%) of 33 patients seroconverted for immunoglobulin G (two platelet-activating) antibodies. No patient developed clinical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Two of six patients with graft function failure had anti-PF4/heparin IgG antibodies at the time of graft function failure. Graft liver biopsy samples from these patients showed thrombotic occlusions of the microcirculation.Anti-PF4/heparin IgG antibodies are generated despite strong pharmacologic suppression of T cells, indicating that T cells likely have a limited role in the immune response to PF4/heparin complexes in humans.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655935","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Platelet factor 4","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_factor_4"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.728404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.715456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.654832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.640061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.635169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.620371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.586462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.571232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.504356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.43476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Platelet aggregation","weight":0.352016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"}]}
