{"id":35043,"title":"Correlating interleukin-12 stimulated interferon-? production and the absence of ectodermal dysplasia and anhidrosis (EDA) in patients with mutations in NF-?B essential modulator (NEMO).","abstract":"Patients with hypomorphic mutations in Nuclear Factor-?B Essential Modulator (NEMO) are immunodeficient (ID) and most display ectodermal dysplasia and anhidrosis (EDA). We compared cytokine production by NEMO-ID patients with and without EDA.PBMCs of NEMO-ID patients, four with EDA carrying E315A, C417R, D311N and Q403X, and three without EDA carrying E315A, E311_L333del and R254G, were cultured with PHA, PHA plus IL-12p70, LPS, LPS plus IFN-?, TNF and IL-1?. The production of various cytokines was measured in the supernatants. Fifty-nine healthy individuals served as controls.PBMCs of NEMO-ID patients without EDA produce subnormal amounts of IFN-? after stimulation with PHA, but normal amounts of IFN-? after PHA plus IL-12p70. In contrast, IFN-? production by patients with EDA was low in both cases. Patients with EDA also generate lower PHA-stimulated IL-10 and IL-1? than controls, whereas the production of these cytokines by patients without EDA was normal.Responses of PBMCs in NEMO-ID patients with EDA to PHA with and without IL-12p70 appear less robust than in NEMO-ID patients without EDA. This possibly indicates a better preserved NEMO function in our patients without EDA.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682681","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.872134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.717011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.712853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.707573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.622929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.406082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Anhidrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhidrosis"},{"name":"Ectodermal dysplasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectodermal_dysplasia"},{"name":"Phytohaemagglutinin","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytohaemagglutinin"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"311 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/311_(band)"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"National Film Board of Canada","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada"},{"name":"Electronic design automation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Subnormal subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnormal_subgroup"},{"name":"Essential Marvel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Marvel"},{"name":"Muller's morphs","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller's_morphs"}]}
