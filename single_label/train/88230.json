{"id":88230,"title":"Thoracoscopy-assisted minimally invasive surgical stabilization of the anterolateral flail chest using Nuss bars.","abstract":"Flail chest is caused by complex fractures of multiple ribs as a result of severe chest injuries, which results in paradoxical chest movements that severely compromise respiratory function. We report our experience of thoracoscopically assisted, minimally invasive surgical stabilization of massive anterolateral flail chest using a Nuss bar in three patients. This technique offers effective stabilization while having the advantages of short surgical time, minimal blood loss, less trauma, quicker recovery,Â and small and inconspicuous incisions.
