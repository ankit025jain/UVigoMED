{"id":50555,"title":"Endothelial progenitor cells as a cardiometabolic risk factor marker in prediabetes.","abstract":"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have recently been considered as a potential novel marker of vascular integrity, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. This study was performed to investigate the main determinants of EPC levels in individuals with prediabetes.Thirty-nine participants with newly diagnosed prediabetes were enrolled. Flow cytometric analysis was used to quantify EPCs (CD34+CD133+VEGFR-2+). Traditional risk factors, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and anthropometric parameters, including ultrasonographic-determined visceral and subcutaneous fat, were recorded.In univariate analysis, EPC levels significantly correlated with waist circumference (p=0.017), mean arterial pressure (p=0.009), total cholesterol (p=0.003), hs-CRP (p=0.006), HOMA-IR (p=0.031) and visceral fat (p=0.040). However, in stepwise multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, only visceral fat retained its statistical significance (OR=0.79, 95%Cl:0.64-0.98, p=0.032).Visceral fat seems to be the main determinant of EPC levels in individuals with prediabetes and to form a plausible link between mild metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular risk and vascular homeostasis
