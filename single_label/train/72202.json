{"id":72202,"title":"Gemtuzumab ozogamicin with fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (FLAG-GO) as front-line regimen in patients with core binding factor acute myelogenous leukemia.","abstract":"Despite being considered \"good-risk\" acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), long term outcomes in core binding factor (CBF) AML suggest room for improvement. We report on a regimen consisting of fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and low dose gemtuzumab ozogamicin (FLAG-GO) as front-line therapy of patients with CBF AML. Forty-five patients were enrolled (median age 48 years). Remission rate was 95% with 5% induction deaths. The overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) probability at 3 years are 78% and 85%, respectively. FLAG-GO regimen results in high rates of RFS and OS in CBF AML. Our data along with recent data from several large groups strongly argues in favor of incorporation of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in frontline regimens for CBF AML.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990142","annotations":[{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Fludarabine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine"},{"name":"Gemtuzumab ozogamicin","weight":0.830959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemtuzumab_ozogamicin"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.699044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.663904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.626629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.593124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.462919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Brazilian Football Confederation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Football_Confederation"},{"name":"Core binding factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_binding_factor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Remote File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_File_System"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
