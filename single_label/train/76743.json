{"id":76743,"title":"Activation of activin type IB receptor signals in pancreatic ? cells leads to defective insulin secretion through the attenuation of ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity.","abstract":"In studies of gene-ablated mice, activin signaling through activin type IIB receptors (ActRIIB) and Smad2 has been shown to regulate not only pancreatic ? cell mass but also insulin secretion. However, it still remains unclear whether gain of function of activin signaling is involved in the modulation of pancreatic ? cell mass and insulin secretion. To identify distinct roles of activin signaling in pancreatic ? cells, the Cre-loxP system was used to activate signaling through activin type IB receptor (ActRIB) in pancreatic ? cells. The resultant mice (pancreatic ? cell-specific ActRIB transgenic (Tg) mice; ActRIBCA?Tg) exhibited a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and a progressive impairment of glucose tolerance. Patch-clamp techniques revealed that the activity of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (KATP channels) was decreased in mutant ? cells. These results indicate that an appropriate level of activin signaling may be required for GSIS in pancreatic ? cells, and that activin signaling involves modulation of KATP channel activity.
