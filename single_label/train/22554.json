{"id":22554,"title":"Beware the normal angiogram.","abstract":"Purulent pericarditis is now rare due to the widespread use of antibiotics. However, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and non-specific symptoms and signs can make diagnosis difficult. We report a patient who presented with left-sided chest pain, mild fever and ST segment elevation on electrocardiography, who required prolonged organ support in the intensive care unit. This lesson highlights the diagnostic difficulties and management challenges that this condition can present.
