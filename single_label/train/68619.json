{"id":68619,"title":"Fibroblast growth factor-23 levels are associated with uric acid but not carotid intima media thickness in renal transplant recipients.","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients and healthy subjects. However, data in renal transplant recipients (RTR) are scarce. We aimed to determine factors associated with FGF-23 and to explore its relationship to atherosclerosis.Forty-six patients and 44 controls were included. FGF-23 was measured from plasma. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) was evaluated ultrasonographically.Patients had higher waist circumference (WC; 92.2 ± 14.9 vs 85.3 ± 11.0 cm; P < .05), glucose (99.8 ± 17.2 vs 90.3 ± 6.5 mg/dL; P < .01), creatinine (1.43 ± 0.6 vs 0.86 ± 0.1 mg/dL; P < .01), triglyceride (160.4 ± 58.9 vs 135.6 ± 59.8 mg/dL; P < .05), white blood cells (WBC; 7938.6 ± 2105.2 vs 6715.7 ± 1807.5 WBC/mm(3); P < .01), ferritin (217.0 ± 255.8 vs 108.3 ± 142.4 ng/mL; P < .05), uric acid (6.5 ± 1.6 vs 4.7 ± 1.3 mg/dL; P < .01), C-reactive protein (CRP; 8.2 ± 18.2 vs 5.3 ± 7.9 mg/L; P < .01), parathyroid hormone (PTH; 89.7 ± 59.2 vs 44.1 ± 16.7 pg/mL; P < .01), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; 162.5 ± 86.6 vs 74.2 ± 21.9 U/L; P < .01). FGF-23 was higher in patients (11.7 ± 7.2 vs 9.6 ± 6.8 pg/mL; P < .05). CIMT was similar (0.58 ± 0.09 vs 0.57 ± 0.1 mm; P > .05). WC, creatinine, and uric acid were positively correlated with FGF-23, whereas albumin showed negative correlation. On multivariate analysis only creatinine and uric acid were determinants of FGF-23.FGF-23 levels are associated with uric acid in RTR. Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507048","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.842154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.731636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.618642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.581318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Tunica intima","weight":0.35861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_intima"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor 23","weight":0.297105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_23"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
