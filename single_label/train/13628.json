{"id":13628,"title":"Gabapentin hybrid peptides and bioconjugates.","abstract":"Synthetic approaches to gabapentin bioconjugates that overcome the tendency of gabapentin to cyclize into its ?-lactam are studied. Gabapentin was converted by N-acylation at its N-terminus into di-, tri-, and tetrapeptides (L-Ala-Gbp, L-Val-Gbp, L-Ala-L-Phe-Gbp, Gly-L-Ala-?-Ala-Gbp). Carboxyl-activated Boc-protected gabapentin was used to N-, O-, and S-acylate small peptides and hormones to give conjugates that could also provide prodrugs containing conformationally constrained gabapentin units.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468631","annotations":[{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.546476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.175879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Gabapentin","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"},{"name":"Prodrug","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
