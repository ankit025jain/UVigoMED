{"id":69183,"title":"[Feasibility of non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography for diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in elderly patients].","abstract":"To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of IFIR-FIESTA technique in detecting renal artery stenosis in elderly patients.Twenty-seven aged patients underwent both IFIR-FIESTA and 3D CE-MRA examinations. The imaging quality and renal artery stenosis grades were evaluated. Kappa test was used to assess the consistency between the two methods. With CE-MRA as the reference, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV for IFIR-FIESTA were calculated in detecting renal artery stenosis.The images by the two methods were 100% qualified for diagnosis, although the image quality of CE-MRA was significantly better. IFIR-FIESTA and CE-MRA showed excellent consistency in detecting renal artery stenosis. With CE-MRA as the reference, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV for IFIR-FIESTA were 97.1%, 100%, 98.1%, 100%, and 95% in detecting renal artery stenosis, respectively.IFIR-FIESTA is feasible as a routine examination for detecting renal artery stenosis in elderly patients.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463123","annotations":[{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.590836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.523222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.356605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Renal artery stenosis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery_stenosis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"}]}
