{"id":21843,"title":"Campylobacteriosis - an overview.","abstract":"Campylobacteriosis is a collective term, used for infectious, emerging foodborne disease caused by Campylobacter species comprising Gram negative, curved, and microaerophilic pathogens. The true incidence of human campylobacteriosis is unknown for most countries of the world including Bangladesh. But campylobacteriosis is not uncommon in our country. Due to its increasing incidence in many countries of the world, it is an important issue now a day. Animals such as birds are the main sources of infection. Farm animals such as cattle, poultry are commonly infected from such sources and raw milk, undercooked or poorly handled meat becomes contaminated. Transmission of campylobacteriosis to human occurs through consumption of infected, unpasteurized animal milk and milk products, undercooked poultry and through contaminated drinking water. Contact with contaminated poultry, livestock or household pets, especially puppies, can also cause disease. Due to variability of clinical features and limited availability of laboratory facilities, the disease remains largely under-reported. Early and specific diagnosis is important to ensure a favourable outcome regarding this food borne disease. Antibiotic treatment is controversial, and has only a benefit on the duration of symptoms. Campylobacter infections can be prevented by some simple hygienic food handling practices.
