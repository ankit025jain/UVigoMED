{"id":37266,"title":"The effect of an intravitreal dexamethasone implant for cystoid macular edema in retinitis pigmentosa: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Intravitreal injection of a dexamethasone implant was used to treat a 24-year-old patient with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) who developed cystoid macular edema (CME) in both eyes that was refractory to oral acetazolamide and intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. After injection, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved and central macular thickness decreased, but CME recurred in both eyes 6 months later. Although a second intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection resolved the CME and improved the BCVA, CME recurred in both eyes 6 months later. The intravitreal dexamethasone implant may be useful for CME in patients with RP, but its efficacy seems to be limited over time.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506098","annotations":[{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Retinitis pigmentosa","weight":0.516559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.438524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.3316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.110256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Acetazolamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetazolamide"},{"name":"Cystoids","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoids"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"List A cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_A_cricket"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Continuing medical education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_medical_education"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Retinitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
