{"id":74277,"title":"Expansion of NK cells by engineered K562 cells co-expressing 4-1BBL and mMICA, combined with soluble IL-21.","abstract":"NK cells hold promise for protecting hosts from cancer and pathogen infection through direct killing and expressing immune-regulatory cytokines. In our study, a genetically modified K562 cell line with surface expression of 4-1BBL and MICA was constructed to expand functional NK cells in vitro for further adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. After a long-term up to 21 day co-culture with newly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of soluble IL-21 (sIL-21), notable increase in proportion of expanded NK cells was observed, especially the CD56(bright)CD16(+) subset. Apparent up-regulation of activating receptors CD38, CD69 and NKG2D was detected on expanded NK cells, so did inhibitory receptor CD94; the cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells against target tumor cells exceeded that of NK cells within fresh PBMCs. The intracellular staining showed expanded NK cells produced immune-regulatory IFN-?. Taken together, we expanded NK cells with significant up-regulation of activating NKG2D and moderate enhancement of cytotoxicity, with IFN-? producing ability and a more heterogeneous population of NK cells. These findings provide a novel perspective on expanding NK cells in vitro for further biology study and adoptive immunotherapy of NK cells against cancer.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859012","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell
