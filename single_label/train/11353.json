{"id":11353,"title":"Detection of avian paramyxoviruses in migratory and resident birds in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","abstract":"Paramyxoviruses and avian influenza viruses are present worldwide, and wild birds are known natural reservoirs of these viruses. This study monitored the circulation of these viruses in migratory and resident coastal birds captured in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In total, 494 birds were trapped, and their fecal samples were collected and inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs. The allantoic fluids were evaluated using a hemagglutination test and PCR amplification of the genes of the M and L proteins of influenza A virus and paramyxovirus, respectively. Avian paramyxovirus was detected in 5 (1.01%) of the birds. The majority of these viruses were isolated from migratory birds classified into the order Charadriiformes (families Scolopacidae and Charadriidae). Four samples were characterized as avian paramyxovirus serotype-2 (APMV-2) by a hemagglutination inhibition test. These results reinforce the importance of continuous surveillance of wild species in Brazil.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597121","annotations":[{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.77844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.746917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.678393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Paramyxovirus","weight":0.666585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramyxovirus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.584596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Natural reservoir","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir"},{"name":"Rio de Janeiro","weight":0.433841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.393917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Charadriiformes","weight":0.388182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadriiformes"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.353316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.27036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.221683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Egg (food)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)"},{"name":"Sandpiper","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpiper"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Charadriidae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadriidae"},{"name":"Rio de Janeiro (state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Allantois","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allantois"}]}
