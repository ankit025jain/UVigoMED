{"id":81979,"title":"Association of periodontal disease with oral cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The objective is to evaluate the association of periodontal disease with the risk of oral cancer. Literature retrieval, selection and assessment, data extraction, and meta-analyses were performed according to the RevMan 5.0 guidelines. In the meta-analysis, we utilized random-effect model to pool the odds ratio (OR) according to the test of heterogeneity. A total of five eligible studies included 1,191 oral cancer patients and 1,992 healthy control subjects were analyzed. By meta-analysis, we found a significant association of periodontal disease with oral cancer [OR = 3.53, 95 % CI (1.52-8.23); P = 0.003]. Patients with periodontal disease have increased susceptibility to oral cancer.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756759","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.252368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.20075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"992","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/992"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Data extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
