{"id":70796,"title":"JLK1486, a N,N-[(8-hydroxyquinoline)methyl]-substituted benzylamine analogue, inhibits melanoma proliferation and induces autophagy.","abstract":"To investigate anti-proliferatory activity of a selected N,N-[(8-hydroxyquinoline)methyl]-substituted benzylamine (JLK1486) on melanoma cells and to characterize its mechanism of cell population growth inhibition.In vitro cultures of B16F10 (mouse melanoma) cells were used as a model to characterize anti-proliferatory activity of JLK1486 using MTT growth assay, trypan blue viability assessment, cell cycle analysis, melanin production, ?-galactosidase and acridine orange staining.Proliferating B16F10 and also MeWo (human melanoma) cells were strongly growth inhibited by JLK1486, displaying IC50 values of 196 nm and 110 nm respectively. Anti-proliferatory effects were independent of cell death and were characterized by a distinct accumulation of cells in G0 /G1 phase. Tyrosinase activity and relative melanin content remained unchanged indicating that the anti-proliferatory activity was not due to phenotype differentiation. Although treated B16F10 cells stained strongly positive for senescence marker ?-galactosidase, cells regained near normal proliferatory activity after removal of JLK1486. Increased acridine orange staining and presence of perinuclear vacuoles suggested induction of autophagy in B16F10 cells. Furthermore, JLK1486 pre-treatment completely abolished melphalan and antimycin A-induced apoptosis.JLK1486 provides a promising chemical scaffold to develop new anti-melanoma drugs or combination therapies, due to its potent inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of autophagy, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139616","annotations":[{"name":"Melanin","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.89669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cellular
