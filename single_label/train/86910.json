{"id":86910,"title":"Prospects for a dengue vaccine: progress and pitfalls.","abstract":"Dengue virus is now the world's most common arboviral infection and has spread to the continental United States. The Aedes mosquito which transmits dengue is prevalent throughout Missouri, so clinicians should be familiar with dengue. While there are no licensed vaccines, five are in human trials including two tested at the Saint Louis University Center for Vaccine Development. Our deepening understanding of the correlates of protective immunity to dengue improves near-term prospects for a vaccine.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211865","annotations":[{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.743674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.455505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Saint Louis University","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_University"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.336641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Missouri","weight":0.334902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.323784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.134152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Aedes","weight":0.133562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes"},{"name":"St. Louis, Missouri","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri"},{"name":"Arbovirus","weight":0.0549552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbovirus"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Saint","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dengue virus","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"License","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Contiguous United States","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
