{"id":12605,"title":"Study on analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of Cordia myxa fruit hydro-alcoholic extract.","abstract":"Cordia myxa is a plant which is used in tropical regions of the world. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect of fruit of this medicinal plant was investigated in mice. Hydro-alcoholic extract of it was prepared by maceration method. Formalin test was conducted in six groups of mice (6 animals in each group) and acetic acid test in another six groups (6 mice). Groups one to six in each test were administered normal saline, oral indomethacin, intraperitoneal tramadol, 100 mg kg(-1) oral extract, 200 mg kg(-1) oral extract and 100 mg kg(-1) intraperitoneal extract, respectively. The duration of foot lickings were calculated in formalin- administered (1st) group within min 0 to 5 (acute phase) and 15 to 25 (chronic phase). Acetic acid-induced writhings were counted within 10 min in the 2nd group. The results showed that hydro-alcoholic extract of Cordia myxa fruit was considerably effective in formalin test. Also, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of this plant's fruit in both acute and chronic phase are somewhat similar to these properties in the study on animal model of experimental colitis.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517032","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.586183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.528695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.447037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.39234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.277373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.24466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Tramadol","weight":0.205003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.18576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.115541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maceration (wine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceration_(wine)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
