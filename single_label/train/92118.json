{"id":92118,"title":"Training-related risk factors in the etiology of overuse injuries in endurance sports.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to clarify training-related risk factors for overuse injuries.This was twelve-month retrospective study which was done by self-reported postal questionnaire. The study group consisted of 446 men and women top-level Finnish athletes representing three different endurance sports (cross-country skiing, swimming, long-distance running) between the ages of 15-35. Self-reported anthropometric and training-related variables (such as starting age of training, years of active training, hours trained yearly, competition hours and weekly resting days) and occurrence of overuse injuries.Athletes with less than 2 rest days per week during the training season had 5.2-fold risk (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.89-14.06, P=0.001) for an overuse injury, and athletes who trained more than 700 hours during a year had 2.1-fold risk (95% CI 1.21-3.61, P=0.008) for an overuse injury compared to the others. Athletes who reported a tendon injury were on average two years older than athletes without such an injury (P<0.001).We found that low number of recovery days and a high amount of training are training-related risk factors for overuse injuries in top-level endurance athletes. The higher number of tendon overuse injuries in older than younger athletes may indicate that age-related degeneration plays an important role in the etiology of tendon injuries. These findings should be taken into account when planning exercise programs for endurance athletes.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445548","annotations":[{"name":"Finland","weight":0.841175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.484532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.457256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.37611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Endurance","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sports injury","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_injury"},{"name":"Skiing","weight":0.193206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing"},{"name":"Cross-country skiing","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing"},{"name":"Repetitive strain injury","weight":0.129837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1535","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1535"},{"name":"Mail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail"},{"name":"Origami","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami"},{"name":"446","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/446"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
