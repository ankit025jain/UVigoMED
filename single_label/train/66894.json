{"id":66894,"title":"[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis: a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency].","abstract":"Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPG) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by kidney damage that can lead to irreversible kidney failure. RPG can be caused by primary glomerular disease or can be part of a systemic autoimmune disorder. All RPG have a similar pathophysiology (proliferation of cells in Bowman's capsule and formation of crescents) and clinical evolution (rapidly progressive kidney failure with proteinuria and an active urine sediment). Immunosuppressive therapy and sometimes plasma exchanges are required. Overall- and kidney survival are closely linked to the blood creatinine level at presentation, the percentage of damaged glomeruli, and to the underlying cause. RPG is therefore a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency that needs quick referral to a nephrologist.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665657","annotations":[{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.857406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.74597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.476917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis","weight":0.169715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly_progressive_glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Sediment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"}]}
