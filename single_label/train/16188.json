{"id":16188,"title":"[Tularemia is spreading from north to south side of Turkey: a small outbreak in Kahramanmaras, Turkey].","abstract":"Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis. Sporadic tularemia cases have been increasingly reported particularly from provinces located at northwest and central regions of Turkey especially during last two decades, as well as waterborne outbreaks reported from almost all regions. Transmission most often occurs through consumption of contaminated water and food, thus, oropharyngeal form is the most common clinical presentation in our country. The aim of this study was to present a small outbreak experience in Afsin, country of Kahramanmaras province located at southern part of Turkey. A total of 10 patients (5 male, 5 female; age range 2-68 years; mean age 25 years) who were admitted to Afsin State Hospital with the complaints of swollen neck between 21 October 2013-22 January 2014, were evaluated considering their clinical findings and treatment outcomes. Following the diagnosis of the first tularemia case coming from Nadir village, a field investigation was performed. All villagers were informed about the disease and water samples from the possible sources of outbreak were collected by provincial health authorities. Lymph node aspirate and serum samples were sent for culture and serologic investigation and the environmental water samples were sent for molecular analysis to the National Tularemia Reference Laboratory at Public Health Institution of Turkey. Six out of 10 patients' sera were found positive in terms of F.tularensis antibodies between the titers of 1/320-1/1280 by microagglutination test (MAT) and diagnosis of oropharyngeal tularemia was based on the clinical and serological findings. One of the patients also presented with oculoglandular form accompanying oropharyngeal form. Cultures from aspirate samples that could be obtained from only two patients yielded negative results. Three out of six patients' lymph nodes were drained surgically and one was drained by ultrasound-guided needle. In one case lymph node suppuration occured spontaneously during examination. Three of the patients were treated with streptomycin, two with ciprofloxacin and one with doxycycline. Although no polymerase chain reaction positivities in terms of F.tularensis were detected in the water samples, the outbreak was thought to be waterborne since the hygienic conditions of the water sources were inadequate and the chlorination procedures were inappropriate. In conclusion, the detection of the first case of tularemia and the following small outbreak in Kahramanmaras region, emphasized that the disease has had a spreading trend from the endemic northern Anatolia to nonendemic southern provinces of Turkey.
