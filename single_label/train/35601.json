{"id":35601,"title":"Management of familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents. Position paper of the Polish Lipid Expert Forum.","abstract":"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) affects on average 1 in 500 individuals in European countries, and it is estimated that FH in Poland may affect more than 80,000 people. However, in Poland, only about 20% of the population is estimated to have been diagnosed with FH, of which only a small number receive adequate treatment. FH results in more rapid development of atherosclerosis and is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events. Atherosclerosis develops beginning in childhood in patients with FH and reaches advanced stages before clinical manifestations develop. Inadequate diagnostics and treatment of FH in Polish children suggests a need for raising the level of awareness and understanding of the condition in both society and among health professionals. These recommendations present the current epidemiological status, guidelines for diagnosing FH in Polish children and adolescents, and effective treatment options.
