{"id":67348,"title":"Obesity and urologic complications after renal transplantation.","abstract":"Although obesity has been associated with improved survival on dialysis, its short-and long-term effects on renal transplantation outcomes remain unclear. Herein, we evaluate the short-term and intermediate long-term effects of obesity on first-time renal transplant patients. A retrospective analysis was performed on 180 consecutive renal transplant recipients from living unrelated donors during 2006-2008 in a major transplantation center in Tehran, Iran. Among these, 34 (18%) patients were found to be obese (body mass index ?30 kg/m 2 ). Obese patients were more likely to develop post-transplant renal artery stenosis (RAS) (17.6% vs. 2.8%, P <0.001), hematoma (47.9% vs. 17.6, P = 0.009), surgical wound complications (64.7% vs. 9.6%, P <0.001) and renal vein thrombosis (2% vs. 0%, P <0.001). However, the incidence of delayed graft function, lymphocele, urologic complications of ureterovesical junction stenosis or urinary leakage, surgical complications of excessive bleeding or renal artery thrombosis and duration of hospitalization were similar between the two groups. The two-year patient and graft survival were also statistically not different. Renal transplantation in obese recipients is associated with a higher incidence of post-transplant RAS, hematoma, surgical wound complications and renal vein thrombosis, but similar two-year patient and graft survival.
