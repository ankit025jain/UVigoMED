{"id":79243,"title":"Prognostic significance of the Wnt pathway in squamous cell laryngeal cancer.","abstract":"We sought to determine the prognostic significance of the Wnt signaling pathway in operable squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.In an annotated cohort of 289 operable laryngeal cancers we evaluated the prognostic impact of E-cadherin, P-cadherin and ?-catenin protein expression with immunohistochemistry, as well as the mRNA expression of 7 key effectors of the Wnt pathway including secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), SNAI2 (SLUG) and WNT5A with qPCR (relative quantification [RQ]).Using median immunoreactive scores as a pre-defined cut-off, patients whose tumors overexpressed both cytoplasmic E-cadherin and ?-catenin experienced longer median OS as compared to those whose tumors overexpressed ?-catenin only (median OS 124 vs. 72 months, p=0.0301) and patients whose tumors overexpressed both cytoplasmic and membranous E-cadherin experienced longer DFS as compared to those whose tumors overexpressed cytoplasmic E-cadherin only (median 118 vs. 91 months, p=0.0106). Upon hierarchical clustering of SFRP4, SNAI2 and WNT5A RQ values, profiles including co-expression of all 3 genes but also profiles with under-expression of SNAI2 and WNT5A were associated with worse outcome as compared to profiles not related to the Wnt pathway. In multivariate analysis, clustering was an independent predictor for DFS (p=0.0221) and OS (p=0.0077).We identified gene expression profiles and IHC patterns associated with aberrant Wnt signaling conferring aggressive clinical behavior in operable squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. Prospective validation of these results will determine whether targeting the Wnt pathway merits investigation in this disease.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461629","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.872543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.649401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.581367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.450172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Annotation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.248132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"SNAI2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAI2"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"}]}
