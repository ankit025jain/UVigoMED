{"id":67446,"title":"[Diagnosis of urinary stress incontinence in men].","abstract":"Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur more frequently with increasing age. LUTS can either be caused by benign prostatic syndrome (BPS) and consecutive subvesical obstruction as well as detrusor hyperactivity. On the other hand, stress urinary incontinence is mostly seen after surgical intervention in the pelvis like radical prostatectomy. Also high volume centers report persisting incontinence rates of 2-4 % after radical prostatectomy.The diagnostic procedure in men with LUTS is divided in two steps: basic diagnostics, followed by a conservative treatment option, and extended diagnostic procedures including measurement of bladder pressure during filling and voiding. In addition, radiologic examinations, including voiding cystouretherogram, retrograde cystogram, CT scan, MRI scan, are added according to the severity of the symptoms and the scheduled surgical procedure. According to the guidelines of the DGU, EAU, AUA, and ICS, this extended examination is also mandatory prior to any surgical procedure like suburethral tapes, artificial sphincters, and sacral foramen neuronal stimulators.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615463","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.810453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Stress incontinence","weight":0.628381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_incontinence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.588917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Detrusor urinae muscle","weight":0.570586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrusor_urinae_muscle"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.451053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.346624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"American Urological Association","weight":0.175367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Urological_Association"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Cystography","weight":0.081755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystography"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.0172523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Retrograde amnesia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
