{"id":53960,"title":"[CCAFU's contribution to the French National Cancer Institute's reference frame: Adrenal malignant tumors].","abstract":"Malignant tumours of the adrenal gland are adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), malignant phaeochromocytomas (MPC) or metastatic tumours. The objective of this article is to propose guidelines for the management of these tumours.A review of the literature was performed by selecting articles on malignant tumours of the adrenal gland published in PUBMED.Abdominal computed tomography is the reference first-line examination. A diameter > 6 cm, a heterogeneous appearance, irregular margins, spontaneous high density (> 20 HU) and delayed wash-out are radiological signs of malignancy. MRI can be used to characterize the tumour with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 99%. Hormone assays and an endocrinology consultation are recommended before any management. When ACC is suspected, (18)FDG-PET is the reference scintigraphic examination, while the isotope of choice for MPC is (18)F-DOPA, which is more sensitive than MIBG. These scintigraphic examinations have a sensitivity close to 100% and allow staging of distant metastases. Percutaneous biopsy has a limited place in the diagnostic work-up. It is only indicated in the case of suspected adrenal metastasis after having excluded phaeochromocytoma and must not be performed in the case of suspected adrenocortical carcinoma. Surgery is first-line treatment for localized and resectable tumours, but is rarely curative due to the high recurrence rate. For ACC, adjuvant therapy by mitotane or adjuvant radiotherapy can be proposed. Metabolic radiotherapy with (131)I-MIBG can be proposed for the treatment of MPC. First-line chemotherapy is indicated in the case of advanced disease or unresectable tumour. Surgical treatment of adrenal metastasis by adrenalectomy is recommended depending on the type and prognosis of the primary cancer.Preoperative laboratory, morphological and scintigraphic assessment is essential before any management. First-line treatment is surgical when the tumour is resectable, but must be completed by adjuvant therapy to limit the risk of recurrence.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System
