{"id":91466,"title":"Comparison of collagen-based vascular closure devices in patients with vs. without severe peripheral artery disease.","abstract":"To compare complication rates of a collagen-based vascular closure device (VCD) in patients with vs. without significant peripheral artery disease (PAD).A total of 382 patients (268 men; mean age 64.6Â±10.8 years) undergoing either an endovascular procedure of the lower limb (PAD group, n=132) or a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI group, n=250) via a common femoral artery access were enrolled in this prospective study if hemostasis was achieved using the collagen-based Angio-Seal. In the PCI group, significant PAD was excluded by measurement of the ankle-brachial index. In-hospital major complications (bleeding, large hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, vessel occlusion, dissection) were recorded.Similar and low rates of major complications were observed in both arms of the study: 2 (1.5%) major complications in the PAD group and 3 (1.2%) in the PCI group (p=1.0). There was no significant difference in efficacy of the VCDs in the groups (PAD group 99.2% vs. 100% in PCI group, p=0.35).Our study shows no significant differences in the rate of major complications after utilization of a collagen-based VCD for femoral artery access site closure in patients with severe lower limb PAD compared to those without; however, complications in the PAD group tended to be more severe, with the need for surgical repair.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502487","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.869543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.816034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.488503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.451284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.375104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0401725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0341376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Video CD","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"610","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/610"},{"name":"268","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/268"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"}]}
