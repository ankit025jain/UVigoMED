{"id":61570,"title":"On the origin of leukemic species.","abstract":"Recent studies (Shlush et al., 2014; Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014) have demonstrated that leukemias develop from hematopoietic stem cells that acquire preleukemic mutations, allowing clonal expansion and subsequent acquisition of mutations leading to cancer. Preleukemic cells survive chemotherapy and serve as reservoirs for disease, generating new clones and leading to relapse.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702991","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.576651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0689687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"}]}
