{"id":38420,"title":"Pharmacologic treatment of downstream of tyrosine kinase 7 congenital myasthenic syndrome.","abstract":"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are increasingly recognized as causes of muscle fatigue and weakness. However, treatment of individual syndromes has been described only in small case series.To analyze the information published thus far concerning the effect of pharmacologic treatment of one of the most common subtypes of CMS, downstream of tyrosine kinase 7 (DOK7) CMS.In a search of the PubMed database, we found 16 publications describing the response to medication in 122 individuals with DOK7 deficiency. The last search was performed August 15, 2013. If more than 1 article had been published by the same group, a comparison of the participants in the studies was made, and data appearing more than once were excluded.Positive effects were observed in 6 of 66 patients who received an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 65 of 69 patients who received ephedrine or salbutamol, 18 of 29 who were given 3,4-diaminopyridine, and 13 of 16 individuals who received a combination of these drugs. Our analysis found no evidence that age at disease onset, age at treatment start, drug dosage, or mutation type influenced treatment results. The magnitude of treatment effect with ephedrine or salbutamol seems to increase gradually, peaking after approximately 6 to 8 months. Treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors resulted in worsened conditions for most patients.This analysis suggests that (1) ephedrine or salbutamol is the first choice of treatment in DOK7 CMS; (2) 3,4-diaminopyridine may provide additional benefi; (3) it is never too late to initiate treatment; and (4) in contrast to acquired myasthenia gravis, treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be avoided in DOK7 CMS.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24425145","annotations":[{"name":"Ephedrine","weight":0.90928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine"},{"name":"Salbutamol","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salbutamol"},{"name":"Myasthenia gravis","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasthenia_gravis"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.855262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.805127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Congenital myasthenic syndrome","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_myasthenic_syndrome"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.175642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert-Eaton_myasthenic_syndrome"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
