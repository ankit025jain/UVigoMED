{"id":82041,"title":"[Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: retrospective study of 185 cases in Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire)].","abstract":"Cutaneous bullous adverse drug eruptions are a dreaded complication of drug use.The purpose of this study was to document the epidemiological features, outcomes, and causes of these reactions, in particular, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell disease), in a teaching hospital in Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire).A retrospective study reviewed the records of severe cutaneous drug reactions in patients managed in the dermatology department of the University Hospital of Treichville (Abidjan) over a period of ten years (from September 2000 through August 2010).These diseases were diagnosed in 185 patients during the study period. Their mean age was 31.8 years (range: 2-70 years) and the M/F sex ratio was 0.6 The most frequent reactions, as expected, were Stevens-Johnson syndrome (73%) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (27%). The drugs most commonly involved were the antibacterial sulfonamides (22.1%), followed by the antiviral nevirapine (11.1%), and the antimalarial agent, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. The fatality rate was 22.5%, including 46% of the patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis and 14.6% of those with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Respiratory distress (39.5%) and dehydration (23.4%) were the primary direct causes of death.Antibacterial sulfonamides are the leading drugs implicated in the occurrence of bullous drug eruptions in Abidjan.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736218","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Antimalarial medication","weight":0.815162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sulfonamide (medicine)","weight":0.80241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dehydration","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.716491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.563785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Toxic epidermal necrolysis","weight":0.381468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.342429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Abidjan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Sex ratio","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_ratio"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
