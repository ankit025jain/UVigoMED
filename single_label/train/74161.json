{"id":74161,"title":"Breast cancer screening practices among first-generation immigrant muslim women.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to identify beliefs about breast cancer, screening practices, and factors associated with mammography use among first-generation immigrant Muslim women in Chicago, IL.A convenience sample of 207 first-generation immigrant Muslim women (Middle Eastern 51%; South Asian 49%) completed a culturally adapted questionnaire developed from established instruments. The questionnaire was administered in Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, or English, based on participant preference. Internal-consistency reliability was demonstrated for all scales (alpha coefficients ranged from 0.64 to 0.91). Associations between enabling, predisposing, and need variables and the primary outcome of mammography use were explored by fitting logistic regression models.Although 70% of the women reported having had a mammogram at least once, only 52% had had one within the past 2 years. Four factors were significant predictors of ever having had a mammogram: years in the United States, self-efficacy, perceived importance of mammography, and intent to be screened. Five factors were significant predictors of adherence (having had a mammogram in the past 2 years): years in the United States, having a primary care provider, perceived importance of mammography, barriers, and intent to be screened.This article sheds light on current screening practices and identifies theory-based constructs that facilitate and hinder Muslim women's participation in mammography screening. Our findings provide insights for reaching out particularly to new immigrants, developing patient education programs grounded in culturally appropriate approaches to address perceived barriers and building women's self-efficacy, as well as systems-level considerations for ensuring access to primary care providers.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865517","annotations":[{"name":"Urdu","weight":0.940946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"},{"name":"Standard Hindi","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Hindi"},{"name":"Arabic language","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language"},{"name":"Muslim","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Chicago","weight":0.488795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.476921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.465655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.427163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.396171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.361749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.275084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Women in Islam","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.258022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.21593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.186179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.150506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Aliyah","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"}]}
