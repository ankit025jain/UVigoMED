{"id":43217,"title":"Intravenous ilaprazole is more potent than oral ilaprazole against gastric lesions in rats.","abstract":"Ilaprazole is a novel proton pump inhibitor that has been marketed as an oral therapy for acid-related diseases in China and Korea. This study aimed to compare the gastroprotective effects of intravenous and enteral ilaprazole in rat models.The rats were divided into 7-8 groups receiving vehicle, esomeprazole, and different doses of intravenous and enteral ilaprazole. The rats were then exposed to indomethacin (30 mg/kg, i.g.), or water-immersion stress and gastric lesions were examined. The effects of different treatments on histamine (10 ?mol/kg/h)-induced acid secretion were also observed.Intravenous ilaprazole exhibited high antiulcer activity in a dose-dependent manner. Ilaprazole at a dose of 3 mg/kg decreased ulcer number and index to the same extent as 20 mg/kg esomeprazole. Moreover, the potency of intravenous ilaprazole is superior to that of intragastric ilaprazole. In anesthetized rats, the inhibitory effect of intravenous ilaprazole on histamine-induced acid secretion is faster and longer-lasting than that of intraduodenal ilaprazole.Intravenous ilaprazole is more potent than oral ilaprazole against indomethacin- or stress-induced gastric lesions, with faster and longer inhibition of acid secretion.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24801687","annotations":[{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.77097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.610738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.535369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.450458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.426206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"China","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Esomeprazole","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
