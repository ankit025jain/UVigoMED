{"id":22635,"title":"Laparoscopic versus open appendicectomy in children: a UK District General Hospital experience.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of laparoscopic appendicectomy in reducing morbidity and length of stay in children compared to open procedures in a UK District General Hospital setting.A three-year retrospective review of children ? 15 years with histologically confirmed appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic (LA) and/or open (OA) appendicectomy was performed. Choice of operation was based on individual surgeon's preference and on patient's body size. Data collected included rate of histologically complicated appendicitis, post-operative length of stay (LOS), and collective and differential morbidity rates, i.e., wound infection, intra-abdominal collection, and ileus. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis. P<0.05 was regarded as significant.Eighty children (70% male) were identified at median age 11 (3-15) years. They could be divided into complicated (n=18, 22%) and simple appendicitis (n=62, 78%). Appendicectomy was performed in all as an OPEN (n=53, 66%) or LAPAROSCOPIC (n=27, 34%) procedure. Both groups were comparable in gender distribution (P=0.11) and rate of complicated appendicitis (30% vs. 19%, respectively; P=0.27). Median age was significantly lower in the OPEN group [10 (3-15) vs. 12 (7-15) years; P<0.004]. Laparoscopic appendicectomy had a significantly lower rate of collective morbidity (3.8% vs. 25.9%; P<0.003), including lower rate of intra-abdominal collection (1.9% vs. 14.8%; P<0.01). Median LOS was not significantly different (1 day vs. 2 days; P=0.14).Laparoscopic appendicectomy in children in a UK District General Hospital is safe and was associated with significantly less post-operative morbidity than the open technique.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528966","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.584941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.416327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.341565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.241924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Appendectomy","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0602563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0385965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Ileus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileus"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Collective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"OPEN (Indian magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEN_(Indian_magazine)"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Group 10 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_10_element"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
