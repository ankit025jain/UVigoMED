{"id":25097,"title":"[Surgical treatment of isolated mitral valve stenosis, complicated by massive thrombosis of left atrium].","abstract":"The results of treatment of 334 patients in the clinic in 1984 - 2013 yrs period were analyzed, who suffered mitral valve stenosis, complicated by massive thrombosis of left atrium (LA). Hospital lethality while the mitral valve prosthesis (including those in combination with correction of a three-cuspid valve) have constituted 6.1%, after open mitral comissurotomy all the patients are alive. Small cavity of a left ventricle, systolic pressure in pulmonary artery over 90 mm Hg, previously performed closed mitral comissurotomy, left atriomegaly, calcinosis of a mitral valve +3 have constituted factors of risk on a hospital stage. Important element to correct is excision of a base-lining and ligation of a LA eyelet, what essentially lowers the hospital lethality risk, rate of thromboembolic complications on a hospital stage.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252410","annotations":[{"name":"Mitral stenosis","weight":0.895163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_stenosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.834208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Left atrium","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.740667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.649041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.610781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.177041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
