{"id":91299,"title":"N-acetylcysteine and selenium modulate oxidative stress, antioxidant vitamin and cytokine values in traumatic brain injury-induced rats.","abstract":"It has been suggested that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and selenium (Se) display neuroprotective activities mediated at least in part by their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties although there is no report on oxidative stress, antioxidant vitamin, interleukin-1 beta (IL)-1? and IL-4 levels in brain and blood of TBI-induced rats. We investigated effects of NAC and Se administration on physical injury-induced brain toxicity in rats. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups. First and second groups were used as control and TBI groups, respectively. NAC and Se were administrated to rats constituting third and forth groups at 1, 24, 48 and 72 h after TBI induction, respectively. At the end of 72 h, plasma, erythrocytes and brain cortex samples were taken. TBI resulted in significant increase in brain cortex, erythrocytes and plasma lipid peroxidation, total oxidant status (TOS) in brain cortex, and plasma IL-1? values although brain cortex vitamin A, ?-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant status (TAS) values, and plasma vitamin E concentrations, plasma IL-4 level and brain cortex and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities decreased by TBI. The lipid peroxidation and IL-1? values were decreased by NAC and Se treatments. Plasma IL-4, brain cortex GSH, TAS, vitamin C and vitamin E values were increased by NAC and Se treatments although the brain cortex vitamin A and erythrocyte GSH-Px values were increased through NAC only. In conclusion, NAC and Se caused protective effects on the TBI-induced oxidative brain injury and interleukin production by inhibiting free radical production, regulation of cytokine-dependent processes and supporting antioxidant redox system.
