Solving human ?-cell development--what does the mouse say?","abstract":"A genetic analysis of patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus has revealed functional conservation of transcription factors critical for ?-cell development in both mouse and man. This finding supports the use of mice for modelling human disease but also highlights the need for additional human-specific studies of ?-cell function.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566816","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.689504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.449819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Conservation biology","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Neonatal diabetes mellitus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
