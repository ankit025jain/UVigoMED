{"id":80086,"title":"Leishmanicidal evaluation of tetrahydroprotoberberine and spirocyclic erythrina-alkaloids.","abstract":"Leishmaniasis is one of the World's most problematic diseases in developing countries. Traditional medicines to treat leishmaniasis have serious side effects, as well as significant parasite resistance problems. In this work, two alkaloids 1 and 2 were obtained from Corydalis govaniana Wall and seven alkaloids 3-9, were obtained from Erythrina verna. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by mass spectrometry and 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy. The leishmanicidal activity of compounds 1-9 against Leishmania amazonensis was tested on promastigote forms and cytotoxicity against J774 (macrophage cell line) was assessed in vitro. Compound 1 showed potent activity (IC50 = 0.18 µg/mL), compared with the standard amphotericin B (IC50 = 0.20 µg/mL). The spirocyclic erythrina-alkaloids showed lower leishmanicidal activity than dibenzoquinolizine type alkaloids.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802983","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.884812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.850585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Alkaloid","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid"},{"name":"Traditional medicine","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.208247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Corydalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corydalis"},{"name":"Spiro compound","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_compound"},{"name":"Erythrina mulungu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrina_mulungu"},{"name":"Promastigote","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promastigote"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"774","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Erythrina","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrina"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
