{"id":71474,"title":"Feasibility and acceptability of an iPad application to explore symptom clusters in adolescents and young adults with cancer.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a computer-based symptom cluster heuristics tool designed to explore symptom clusters experienced by adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. The Computerized Symptom Capture Tool (C-SCAT) is a newly developed iPad application, which combines graphical images and free text responses in an innovative heuristics approach to explore symptoms and symptom clusters.Seventy-two AYAs (13-29 years of age) with cancer at five institutions across the US completed the C-SCAT 24-96 hours after the initial chemotherapy dose in a chemotherapy cycle.All participants completed the C-SCAT successfully in a mean of 25 minutes, with 74% reporting that the final image was an accurate or very accurate representation of their symptom experience. Little clarification/coaching was necessary while completing the C-SCAT. Few technical problems were encountered. Participants judged the C-SCAT questions to be clear and endorsed ease of following instructions, typing, and drawing.The C-SCAT demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. With refinement based on study results, the C-SCAT has potential to: (a) empower AYAs to communicate their symptom experience and partner with providers in their care; (b) improve symptom management and ameliorate distress; and (c) translate to use with other highly symptomatic populations.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25066927","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Heuristic","weight":0.387592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.26009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Graphics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"IPad","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"1329","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1329"},{"name":"Typewriter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tool (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_(band)"},{"name":"Empowerment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"},{"name":"Representation (arts)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts)"}]}
