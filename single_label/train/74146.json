{"id":74146,"title":"Release modeling and comparison of nanoarchaeosomal, nanoliposomal and pegylated nanoliposomal carriers for paclitaxel.","abstract":"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women. Recently, delivering by nanocarriers has resulted in a remarkable evolution in treatment of numerous cancers. Lipid nanocarriers are important ones while liposomes and archaeosomes are common lipid nanocarriers. In this work, paclitaxel was used and characterized in nanoliposomal and nanoarchaeosomal form to improve efficiency. To increase stability, efficiency and solubility, polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG 2000) was added to some samples. MTT assay confirmed effectiveness of nanocarriers on MCF-7 cell line and size measuring validated nano-scale of particles. Nanoarchaeosomal carriers demonstrated highest encapsulation efficiency and lowest release rate. On the other hand, pegylated nanoliposomal carrier showed higher loading efficiency and less release compared with nanoliposomal carrier which verifies effect of PEG on improvement of stability and efficiency. Additionally, release pattern was modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). Using ANN modeling for release prediction, resulted in R values of 0.976, 0.989 and 0.999 for nanoliposomal, pegylated nanoliposomal and nanoarchaeosomal paclitaxel and GA modeling led to values of 0.954, 0.951 and 0.976, respectively. ANN modeling was more successful in predicting release compared with the GA strategy.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867099","annotations":[{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.869042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.752252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.598854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artificial neural network","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.386555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Nanomedicine","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nanoscopic scale","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoscopic_scale"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Molecular encapsulation","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_encapsulation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Subatomic particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
