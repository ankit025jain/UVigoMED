{"id":11763,"title":"In vivo ablation of type I interferon receptor from cardiomyocytes delays coxsackieviral clearance and accelerates myocardial disease.","abstract":"Acute coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection is one of the most prevalent causes of acute myocarditis, a disease that frequently is identified only after the sudden death of apparently healthy individuals. CVB3 infects cardiomyocytes, but the infection is highly focal, even in the absence of a strong adaptive immune response, suggesting that virus spread within the heart may be tightly constrained by the innate immune system. Type I interferons (T1IFNs) are an obvious candidate, and T1IFN receptor (T1IFNR) knockout mice are highly susceptible to CVB3 infection, succumbing within a few days of challenge. Here, we investigated the role of T1IFNs in the heart using a mouse model in which the T1IFNR gene can be ablated in vivo, specifically in cardiomyocytes. We found that T1IFN signaling into cardiomyocytes contributed substantially to the suppression of viral replication and infectious virus yield in the heart; in the absence of such signaling, virus titers were markedly elevated by day 3 postinfection (p.i.) and remained high at day 12 p.i., a time point at which virus was absent from genetically intact littermates, suggesting that the T1IFN-unresponsive cardiomyocytes may act as a safe haven for the virus. Nevertheless, in these mice the myocardial infection remained highly focal, despite the cardiomyocytes' inability to respond to T1IFN, indicating that other factors, as yet unidentified, are sufficient to prevent the more widespread dissemination of the infection throughout the heart. The absence of T1IFN signaling into cardiomyocytes also was accompanied by a profound acceleration and exacerbation of myocarditis and by a significant increase in mortality.Acute coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection is one of the most common causes of acute myocarditis, a serious and sometimes fatal disease. To optimize treatment, it is vital that we identify the immune factors that limit virus spread in the heart and other organs. Type I interferons play a key role in controlling many virus infections, but it has been suggested that they may not directly impact CVB3 infection within the heart. Here, using a novel line of transgenic mice, we show that these cytokines signal directly into cardiomyocytes, limiting viral replication, myocarditis, and death.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574394","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial
