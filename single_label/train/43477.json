{"id":43477,"title":"Does long intestinal tube splinting aggravate intestinal adhesions?","abstract":"Long intestinal tube splinting (LITS) is useful for clinically reducing the recurrence of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). However, a controversy exists whether LITS aggravates intestinal adhesions. This study evaluated the postoperative effects of LITS relative to simple enterolysis on intestinal adhesions in an experimental porcine model.A porcine model (n = 24) of dense intestinal adhesion was established by abrading the ileal wall with sterile P240 sandpaper. Enterolysis was performed on postoperative day 14. Animals were randomly divided into a group that underwent enterolysis only (control; n = 12) and those who underwent LITS as well as enterolysis (LITS; n = 12). The long intestinal tube was removed on post-LITS day 14, after abdominal radiography. All animals were euthanized on postenterolysis day 28 for assessment of intestinal adhesions using a semiquantitative macroscopic grading scale, hematoxylin-eosin histology, and hydroxyproline assay.Prior to enterolysis, the experimentally induced intestinal adhesions of the two groups were similar in extent and severity. On postenterolysis day 28 the LITS and control groups were comparable with regard to adhesion loop length (p = .440), macroscopic adhesion severity (p = .820), serosal fibrosis grading (p = .450), and hydroxyproline content of the adhesion ileal segment (p = .630).Placement of the long intestinal tube did not aggravate intestinal adhesions over that of simple enterolysis in this intestinal adhesion porcine model.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785831","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.64519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.638775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.469564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.319151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Serous membrane","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_membrane"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.159241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Hydroxyproline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyproline"},{"name":"Sandpaper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpaper"},{"name":"Anti-Social Behaviour Order","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Social_Behaviour_Order"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/820"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Local loop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_loop"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"2011 Australian Open","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
