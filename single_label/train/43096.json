{"id":43096,"title":"Long noncoding RNA SPRY4-IT1 is upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and associated with poor prognosis.","abstract":"LncRNA SPRY4-IT1 has been shown to promote the progression of melanoma. However, the role of lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical significance and biological functions of SPRY4-IT1 in ESCC. The expression levels of lncRNA SPRY4-IT in 92 ESCC patients and 8 ESCC cell lines were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The prognostic significance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to suppress SPRY4-IT1 expression in ESCC cell lines. Both in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to further explore its role in tumor progression. SPRY4-IT1 levels were significantly higher in ESCC tissues and cells than in corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues and nontumorigenic esophageal epithelial cells, and the ESCC patients with higher SPRY4-IT1 expression had an advanced clinical stage and poorer prognosis than those with lower SPRY4-IT1 expression. The multivariate analysis revealed that SPRY4-IT1 expression level is an independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients. In vitro assays demonstrated that knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 reduced cell proliferation, invasiveness, and migration. In vivo assays demonstrated that knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 decreases cell growth. SPRY4-IT1 is a novel molecule involved in ESCC progression, which may provide a potential prognostic biomarker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810925","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.89765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.372778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Long non-coding RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
