{"id":91398,"title":"Efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrate in trauma patients--a systematic review.","abstract":"Uncontrolled bleeding is the main preventable cause of death in severe trauma patients. Fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor to decrease during trauma-induced coagulopathy, suggesting that pharmacological replacement might assist early hemorrhage control. Several sources of fibrinogen are available; however, fibrinogen concentrate (FC) is not routinely used in trauma settings in most countries. The aim of this review is to summarize the available literature evaluating the use of FC in the management of severe trauma.Studies reporting the administration of FC in trauma patients published between January 2000 and April 2013 were identified from MEDLINE and from the Cochrane Library.The systematic review identified 12 articles reporting FC usage in trauma patients: 4 case reports, 7 retrospective studies, and 1 prospective observational study. Three of these were not restricted to trauma patients.Despite methodological flaws, some of the available studies suggested that FC administration may be associated with a reduced blood product requirement. Randomized trials are warranted to determine whether FC improves outcomes in prehospital management of trauma patients or whether FC is superior to another source of fibrinogen in early hospital management of trauma patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508201","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.748124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.668787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.642588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.638159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.484469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.425845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"List of preventable causes of death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_preventable_causes_of_death"},{"name":"Blood product","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_product"}]}
