{"id":57887,"title":"Anti-Müllerian hormone concentration as a biomarker of pregnancy success or failure.","abstract":"This study was conducted to determine serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration influence on pregnancy outcome.In this study we investigated sixty one infertile women (aged 27 to 44 years) who were diagnosed and treated between 2011 and 2013. We determine ovarian reserve measured by AMH concentration. Patients were divided in three groups according to their serum AMH concentration (<1 ng/ml; 1-2.5 ng/ml; >2.5 ng/ml respectively). We investigated the relationship between clinical pregnancy rate and AMH concentration. In addition, anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TG and/or anti-TPO) positivity and insulin concentration were correlated with AMH level and pregnancy outcome in the study groups.We found no statistical differences between AMH concentration regarding number of pregnancies (42.3%; 41.1 %; 38.9% respectively in study groups; p>0.05). The miscarriage rate was highest in women with AMH>2.5 ng/mL (27.3%, 0%, 86% respectively in study groups; p>0.05). We found that anti-thyroid positivity is more frequent in women with lower AMH concentration (23.1%; 11.7%; 5.5% respectively; p>0.05) and patients with lower serum AMH had higher serum insulin concentration (p<0.05).It seems that AMH concentration might not reflect oocyte quality and the chance of pregnancy, but increased AMH concentration may be associated with negative pregnancy outcome. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and increased insulin serum concentration may be connected to diminished ovarian reserve measured by AMH concentration.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038595","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.766577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.708844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Ovarian reserve","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_reserve"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.248425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.221729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Antimullerian hormone","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimullerian_hormone"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"27 Club","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club"}]}
