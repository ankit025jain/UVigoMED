{"id":90462,"title":"Comparison of the accuracy and reproducibility of focused abdominal sonography for trauma performed by emergency medicine and radiology residents.","abstract":"We compared the diagnostic accuracy of emergency medicine residents (EMRs) and radiology residents (RRs) in performing focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST). The cohort in this prospective study comprised 200 unstable patients (163 males and 37 females; mean ± standard deviation of age, 34.3 ± 16.4 y) who presented with trauma. These patients were evaluated using FAST, first by EMRs and subsequently by RRs. Patients with positive FAST results underwent further diagnostic procedures such as computed tomography, diagnostic peritoneal lavage and laparotomy. Those with negative FAST results underwent clinical follow-up for 72 h until their condition deteriorated or they were discharged. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy in evaluating free intraperitoneal fluid were 80%, 95%, 57%, 98% and 94% when FAST was performed by EMRs and 86%, 95%, 59%, 98% and 94% when FAST was performed by RRs. The level of agreement between EMRs and RRs was moderate (? = 0.525). FAST is a useful screening tool for initial assessment of free abdominal fluid in patients with trauma. Our results indicate that EMRs can perform sonography on trauma patients as successfully as RRs.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613553","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.763039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.603602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Diagnostic peritoneal lavage","weight":0.529517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_peritoneal_lavage"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.34725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Focused assessment with sonography for trauma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focused_assessment_with_sonography_for_trauma"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
