{"id":61386,"title":"[Radiation therapy for malignant lymphoma].","abstract":"Malignant lymphoma is usually radiosensitive and radiation therapy is an effective modality for local control of lymphoma. However, lymphoma is a typical systemic disease, and chemotherapy is performed for many cases. Recently, the late adverse events associated with radiotherapy (especially extended field radiation therapy), such as cardiovascular disease and secondary cancers, become a serious problem for long-term lymphoma survivors. In combination with chemotherapy, it is possible to reduce both the treatment volume and the overall treatment dose to minimise the risks of late adverse events.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724405","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.622683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
