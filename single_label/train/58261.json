{"id":58261,"title":"Cardiac, obstetric, and fetal outcomes during pregnancy after biological or mechanical aortic valve replacement.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess pregnancy-related cardiac, maternal, and fetal outcomes in women who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR).From 1978-2011, 67 women < 40 years of age underwent 74 isolated AVRs (52 mechanical prostheses and 22 bioprostheses). All patients were prospectively followed at our dedicated valve clinic. Patients with Turner syndrome, previous hysterectomy, or tubal ligation were excluded. Cardiovascular, obstetric, and fetal outcomes were gathered from medical records and telephone interviews.A total of 27 pregnancies were reported in 14 patients (bioprosthetic AVR, n = 20; mechanical AVR, n = 7). In the bioprosthetic AVR group, the following adverse events occurred: hospitalizations for syncope (n = 2), prosthetic valve deterioration after pregnancy necessitating reintervention 6 months postpartum (n = 1), miscarriages (n = 9), and preterm birth (n = 1). In the mechanical AVR group, the following adverse events occurred: embolic myocardial infarctions with a decrease in systolic function (n = 2; 1 pregnancy was terminated and 1 was completed), miscarriage (n = 1), postpartum bleeding (n = 1), urgent cesarean section for placental abruption (n = 1), and preterm birth (n = 1).Findings from this study suggest that pregnancies in women with mechanical AVRs are associated with a higher risk of cardiac and obstetric adverse events. Thus, from this limited cohort, it appears that pregnancies in women with bioprostheses are safer than those in patients with mechanical AVRs.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970791","annotations":[{"name":"Turner syndrome","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome"},{"name":"Placental abruption","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental_abruption"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.86437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.861972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Postpartum hemorrhage","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Tubal ligation","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubal_ligation"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Artificial heart valve","weight":0.631972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart_valve"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.604047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.571995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.538962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.37225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.342956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.250485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0187256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"}]}
