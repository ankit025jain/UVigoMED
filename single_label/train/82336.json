{"id":82336,"title":"Retrograde intubation in the patient with cystic tumor located at the base of tongue.","abstract":"Retrograde intubation is one of the methods used to maintain an airway in the event of a difficult intubation. Retrograde intubation has been successfully carried out on patient for whom intubation was not possible with a direct laryngoscope and fiber optic bronchoscope. The central venous catheter needle and guide wire are the materials that are the most practical to prepare and access for the retrograde intubation. To conclude, In conclusion, retrograde intubation may be good alternative to invasive airway management such as surgical tracheostomy for difficult or impossible intubations because it can be performed easily, quickly, and successfully.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649792","annotations":[{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.878999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.801736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.710712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.660126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Peripheral venous catheter","weight":0.646856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.597539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.583298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.552062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Retrograde amnesia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"}]}
