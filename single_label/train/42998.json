{"id":42998,"title":"Inhibitory effects of ?-pinene on hepatoma carcinoma cell proliferation.","abstract":"Pine needle oil from crude extract of pine needles has anti-tumor effects, but the effective component is not known.In the present study, compounds from a steam distillation extract of pine needles were isolated and characterized. Alpha-pinene was identified as an active anti-proliferative compound on hepatoma carcinoma BEL-7402 cells using the MTT assay.Further experiments showed that ?-pinene inhibited BEL-7402 cells by arresting cell growth in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, downregulating Cdc25C mRNA and protein expression, and reducing cycle dependence on kinase 1(CDK1) activity.Taken together, these findings indicate that ?-pinene may be useful as a potential anti-tumor drug.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815485","annotations":[{"name":"Cdk1","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdk1"},{"name":"Cdc25","weight":0.860978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdc25"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cyclin-dependent kinase","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase"},{"name":"M phase","weight":0.754808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_phase"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.693133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.634572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.53219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.495466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.329545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.277421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.272123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pine","weight":0.208247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Steam distillation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_distillation"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
