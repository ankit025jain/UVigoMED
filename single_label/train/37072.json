{"id":37072,"title":"Plasma homocysteine in patients with retinal vein occlusion.","abstract":"To evaluate total plasma homocysteine (HCY) during fasting and post methionine load test (MLT), serum folate, serum vitamin B12, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation in patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and to examine the association between these risk factors and 2 subtypes of RVO: central (CRVO) and branch (BRVO).This case-control study included 91 Italian patients presenting a first RVO and 71 healthy subjects, matched by age, without history of thromboembolic diseases, glaucoma, or malignancy. Homocysteine fasting and after MLT, serum folate level, serum vitamin B12 level, and other laboratory tests were assessed. Genetic analysis for the C677T MTHFR mutation was performed.Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-5.30; p = 0.007), higher values of fasting HCY (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.33; p = 0.03), and low concentrations of vitamin B12 (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.995-0.999; p = 0.01) were independently correlated with RVO. Moreover, the main determinants for CRVO risk were hypertension (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.06-5.72; p = 0.04), high values of fasting HCY (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.02-1.41; p = 0.03), and low concentrations of vitamin B12 (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.994-0.999; p = 0.008), whereas for BRVO risk only hypertension was significant (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.24-6.03; p = 0.01). Genotype distribution of the MTHFR C677T mutation did not reveal any significant difference between patients and controls.These results suggest that elevated fasting HCY levels, low vitamin B12 levels, and hypertension are associated with a risk of RVO, especially for CRVO. Moreover, our data suggest that only hypertension is associated with BRVO risk.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519513","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.738828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.674784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.658078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.647422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.491132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.448069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.316654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.290373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.270166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
