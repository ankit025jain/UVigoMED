{"id":89758,"title":"[Clinical and immunological features of stress reactivity in the dynamics of ocular burn].","abstract":"A series of clinical and immunological studies revealed peculiarities of stress reactivity in the course of ocular burn. According to adrenergic receptor expression level in active T-lymphocytes and its trend in the dynamics of ocular burn 2 types and 7 variants of individual adrenergic immune reactivity were identified and a physiologically adequate variant of stress reactivity was determined.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684065","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.614877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
