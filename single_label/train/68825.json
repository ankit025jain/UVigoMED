{"id":68825,"title":"Fatostatin displays high antitumor activity in prostate cancer by blocking SREBP-regulated metabolic pathways and androgen receptor signaling.","abstract":"Current research links aberrant lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis with prostate cancer development and progression. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP; SREBP-1 and SREBP-2) are key transcription factors controlling lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis via the regulation of genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Overexpression of SREBPs has been reported to be significantly associated with aggressive pathologic features in human prostate cancer. Our previous results showed that SREBP-1 promoted prostate cancer growth and castration resistance through induction of lipogenesis and androgen receptor (AR) activity. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-prostate tumor activity of a novel SREBP inhibitor, fatostatin. We found that fatostatin suppressed cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation in both androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells. Fatostatin also reduced in vitro invasion and migration in both the cell lines. Further, fatostatin caused G2-M cell-cycle arrest and induced apoptosis by increasing caspase-3/7 activity and the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP. The in vivo animal results demonstrated that fatostatin significantly inhibited subcutaneous C4-2B tumor growth and markedly decreased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level compared with the control group. The in vitro and in vivo effects of fatostatin treatment were due to blockade of SREBP-regulated metabolic pathways and the AR signaling network. Our findings identify SREBP inhibition as a potential new therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Male Urogenital
