{"id":62228,"title":"[Lymphedema].","abstract":"Chronic swelling due to lymphatic insufficiency (lymphedema) is a common problem after surgical operations, radiation therapy, injuries and infections. Overweight is a new but rapidly increasing component of lymphedema. Treatment of lymphedema is based on compression therapy, lymph therapy and physiotherapy as well as various surgical treatment alternatives. Curative treatment has not been available. Over the last few years new imaging methods, surgical techniques and Finnish basic research have provided new tools for diagnostics and therapy.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605428","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.863178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.2394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Pure research","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_research"},{"name":"Cold compression therapy","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_compression_therapy"}]}
