{"id":81237,"title":"The crisis of women and at-risk populations needing dental care in Tennessee: challenges and engagement efforts.","abstract":"Women's health issues are receiving increased attention, including the differences in their dental needs and experiences. Biological and social factors are strong determinants of physical and dental health along the entire life spectrum. Socio-environmental place also contributes significantly to some of the barriers to quality and quantity of health care received, placing population groups who have less access to care at risk. Considerable disparities exist in who receives dental care and what type of dental treatment is received among different segments of the population. Greater illumination of these issues in all discussions related to healthcare of women and at-risk populations continues to be a needed focus of concern. The plight of women and at-risk populations and problems influencing access to care are addressed.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241501","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.454854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.373478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.299962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Tennessee","weight":0.153296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Engagement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"}]}
