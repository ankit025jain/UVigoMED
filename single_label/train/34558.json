{"id":34558,"title":"Reoperations for pediatric and congenital heart disease: an analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) congenital heart surgery database.","abstract":"In this descriptive analysis, data in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database pertaining to patients who underwent reoperative cardiac surgery were analyzed. Practice patterns and outcomes are described. Reoperative cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease is common, with one third of index operations in the database occurring subsequent to prior cardiothoracic operation(s) performed on cardiopulmonary bypass. This analysis suggests that a history of previous cardiac surgery does not independently confer a significant incremental risk of operative mortality, but that patients with greater number of previous operations appear to be at higher risk.
