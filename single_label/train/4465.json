{"id":4465,"title":"[Medical emergency treatment is here to stay].","abstract":"Lifelessness in a hospital ward is usually due to an hours-long disturbance of vital functions. The earlier the worsening of the patient's condition is observed, the simpler will the therapeutic measures often be that are sufficient to correct the condition. The medical emergency team will be called to a critically ill patient. The personnel of the hospital ward must be able to recognize in time a patient who will benefit from intensifying the treatment. The most important link of the medical emergency treatment chain is in fact the same as outside the hospital--calling for help early enough.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558593","annotations":[{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.307882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Ward (country subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Chain store","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_store"}]}
