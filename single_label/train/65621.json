{"id":65621,"title":"Spacer application for prostate cancer radiation therapy.","abstract":"Definitive radiotherapy is a well-recognized treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Rectum toxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-volume correlations have been reported in many studies. The application of a spacer to increase the distance between the prostate and anterior rectal wall is an innovative technique, considerably reducing the dose to the rectum. Hyaluronic acid, human collagen, an inflatable balloon or hydrogel are potential materials to create the desired effect. The number of clinical studies is rapidly increasing. Well-tolerated injection or implantation techniques and low rectal treatment-related toxicity have been demonstrated in prospective studies. Long-term clinical results and the results of randomized studies are needed to better define the beneficial effect for the patient.
