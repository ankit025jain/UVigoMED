{"id":72549,"title":"RARs and microRNAs.","abstract":"MicroRNA MicroRNA s (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs acting as endogenous regulators of gene expression. Their discovery is one of the major recent breakthroughs in molecular biology. miRNAs establish a multiplicity of relationships with target mRNAs and exert pleiotropic biological effects in many cell physiological pathways during development and adult life. The dynamic nature of gene expression regulation by Retinoic Acid Retinoic acid (RA) is consistent with an extensive functional interplay with miRNA activities. In fact, RA regulates the expression of many different miRNAs, thus suggesting a relevant function of miRNAs in RA-controlled gene expression programmes. miRNAs have been extensively studied as targets and mediators of the biological activity of RA during embryonic development as well as in normal and neoplastic cells. However, relatively few studies have experimentally explored the direct contribution of miRNA function to the RA signalling pathway. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanistic aspects that allow miRNA biogenesis, functional activation and regulation, focusing on recent evidence that highlights a functional interplay between miRNAs and RA-regulated molecular networks. We report examples of tissue-specific roles of miRNAs modulated by RA in stem cell pluripotency maintenance and regeneration, embryonic development, hematopoietic and neural differentiation, and other biological model systems, underlining their role in disease pathogenesis. We also address novel areas of research linking the RA signalling pathway to the nuclear activity of miRNAs.
