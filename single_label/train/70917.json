{"id":70917,"title":"[Evaluation of breath alcohol concentration after the administration of alcohol-based docetaxel].","abstract":"In the present study, we measured breath alcohol concentration(BAC)after the administration of alcohol-containing docetaxel(OTX)in breast cancer patients, and examined the safety of OTX outpatient administration. Twenty breast cancer patients who received OTX chemotherapy at our outpatient facility were included. The administered doses were 100mg/m2 in 5 cases, 75mg/m / 2 in 13 cases, and 60 mg/m2 in 2 cases. BAC was measured 3 times: immediately after infusion, 30 minutes after infusion, and 60 minutes after infusion. No symptoms of hot flash or drunkenness due to alcohol were observed. BAC was detected in 10 cases(50%)immediately after infusion, in 7 cases(35%)at 30 minutes after infusion, and in 1 case(5%) at 60 minutes after infusion. BAC was more than 0.15mg/L in only 1 case(5%)and reduced to less than 0.15mg/L in all cases after 30 minutes. Our results suggest that the effects of alcohol are alleviated 60 minutes after infusion and that patients receiving OTX could return home safely.
