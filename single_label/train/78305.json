{"id":78305,"title":"[Pediatric anesthesia in ear nose throat (ENT) surgery].","abstract":"ENT procedures are the most common surgeries in children - an optimal anesthetic management provides an uncomplicated, safe perioperative process with as little discomfort for the child as possible. Children at risk must already be identified preoperatively: the combination of ENT surgery, airway susceptibility and age below 3 years can increase the rate of perioperative respiratory adverse events. Postoperatively, it is important to prevent complications such as pain and PONV by dedicated prevention and treatment strategies, as well as to recognize and treat respiratory or circulatory complications competent. Interdisciplinary guidelines and agreements as well as the overall competence of the team have the potential to improve patient safety and outcome in children.
