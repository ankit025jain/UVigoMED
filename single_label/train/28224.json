{"id":28224,"title":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA and neutralising antibodies in milk collected according to local customs from dromedary camels, Qatar, April 2014.","abstract":"Antibodies to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were detected in serum and milk collected according to local customs from 33 camels in Qatar, April 2014. At one location, evidence for active virus shedding in nasal secretions and/or faeces was observed for 7/12 camels; viral RNA was detected in milk of five of these seven camels. The presence of MERS-CoV RNA in milk of camels actively shedding the virus warrants measures to prevent putative food-borne transmission of MERS-CoV.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957745","annotations":[{"name":"RNA","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Camel","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.446644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Viral shedding","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Dromedary","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Qatar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Customs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"},{"name":"Warrant (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"}]}
