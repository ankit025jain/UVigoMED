{"id":17679,"title":"Hospital antimicrobial stewardship in the nonuniversity setting.","abstract":"Inappropriate antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance persist across the healthcare continuum. Antimicrobial stewardship guidelines assist healthcare institutions in establishing antimicrobial stewardship programs but rely on infectious diseases expertise and leadership, which are not available in all settings. Despite this, many institutions have found ways to use available resources to perform stewardship activities, with improvements in antimicrobial use and reductions in resistance and cost. This article highlights success stories in nonuniversity hospital settings and proposes antimicrobial stewardship strategies that may be more feasible in settings with limited infectious diseases expertise, information technology, or financial resources.
