{"id":79328,"title":"Factors associated with success with hearing aids in older adults.","abstract":"To examine associations between audiological and non-audiological factors and successful hearing aid use in older adults.In a retrospective study, audiological factors, attitudinal beliefs (as derived from the health belief model), client demographics, psychological factors, and age-related factors were evaluated.Participants included 160 individuals, 60 years or older, with unilateral or bilateral hearing impairment (HI), fitted with hearing aids for the first time in the previous two years. Participants were assigned to either an unsuccessful hearing aid owner group (n=75) or a successful hearing aid owner group (n=85) based on their self-reported hearing aid use and benefit.A multivariate, binomial logistic regression model indicated five factors associated with group membership: participants who had greater support from significant others; more difficulties with hearing and communication in everyday life before getting hearing aids; more positive attitudes to hearing aids; coupled with greater perceived self-efficacy for advanced handling of hearing aids; or who were receiving more gain from their devices; were more likely to be successful hearing aid owners.These findings highlight the importance of addressing non-audiological factors in order to assist older adults achieve success with hearing aids.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447233","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.722947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.474575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.346926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Personal life","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life"},{"name":"Hawaii","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Binomial nomenclature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Behavioral economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Customer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Social identity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"}]}
