{"id":46478,"title":"Peri-operative management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery.","abstract":"Peri-operative management of the risks of hemorrhage and thrombosis related to gastrointestinal surgery tailored to patient characteristics are part of daily multidisciplinary practice tasks. The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631468","annotations":[{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.849453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.844011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.791023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.765427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.62243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.573737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.375267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Ticagrelor","weight":0.3624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticagrelor"},{"name":"Prasugrel","weight":0.347629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasugrel"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.337377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
