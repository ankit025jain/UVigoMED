{"id":88502,"title":"How can you prevent falls and subsequent fractures?","abstract":"Over the years, a number of strategies have been investigated to prevent falls in older people in a number of settings. Over 200 randomised controlled trials now exist, and the challenge for the discerning clinician is to read and interpret the existing literature so as to be able to implement effective strategies, targeting the right individual with the right intervention. This chapter reviews the current literature and attempts to simplify what has become an enormously complex area. Interventions are reviewed in three main settings - community, hospital and care facilities and based on the type of approach - single, multiple or multifactorial interventions. It also considers the reality in which we practise and provides some 'best bets' to consider at this point in time.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836338","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.417683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.317908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.254651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.164349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.146252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gambling","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"}]}
