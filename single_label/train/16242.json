{"id":16242,"title":"A novel approach to reconstruct a large full thickness abdominal wall defect: successful treatment with MatriDerm® and Split.","abstract":"Reconstruction of large abdominal wall defects is a challenging procedure, often contraindicated in critically ill patients, with high incidences of complications. We present a case of a patient with a large abdominal wall defect who had reconstruction with MatriDerm® (an engineered dermal template) and split thickness skin grafting (SSG) as an alternative to reconstruction with myo- or fascio-cutaneous flaps. Successful wound closure was achieved with a single technique, while providing a robust reconstruction and an interface between skin and underlying viscera, should further surgery be necessary.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041311","annotations":[{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.69329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.363249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.204947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Abdominal wall defect","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall_defect"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Split, Croatia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
