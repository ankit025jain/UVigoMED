{"id":67099,"title":"The effect of mild to moderate renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the nucleoside analog hepatitis C virus polymerase inhibitor mericitabine.","abstract":"Mericitabine is the prodrug of RO4995855, a selective inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase. This study assessed the effect of renal impairment on RO4995855 pharmacokinetics. In this open-label study, HCV-negative volunteers (18-75 years) with normal renal function (NRF: creatinine clearance [CLCR ] >80?mL/min, n?=?10) or stable renal impairment (mild: CLCR 50-80?mL/min, n?=?10; moderate: CLCR 30-49?mL/min, n?=?10) received oral mericitabine 1000?mg twice daily (BID) (500?mg BID for moderate renal impairment) for 5 days. Primary outcome measures were renal clearance, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and area under the concentration-time curve (0-12?h) (AUC0-12) for RO4995855. Renal clearance decreased as renal function decreased. Relative to subjects with NRF, the geometric mean ratios (GMR) for AUC0-12 and Cmax in mild renal impairment subjects were 1.45 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.66) and 1.14 (1.02-1.28), respectively. For moderate renal impairment subjects, the dose-normalized GMR for AUC0-12 and Cmax relative to NRF subjects were 2.51 (90% CI, 2.19-2.88) and 1.76 (1.56-1.97), respectively. Renal clearance of RO4995855 declined in subjects with mild/moderate renal impairment following mericitabine. Dose adjustment of mericitabine may be required in patients with moderate renal impairment.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648253","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.898002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Prodrug","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.774204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.710976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Nucleoside analog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_analog"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"1875","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1875"},{"name":"261","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/261"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Bardo Pond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Pond"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Cmax (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmax_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
