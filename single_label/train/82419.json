{"id":82419,"title":"[Dental caries and treatment needs in adolescents from the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil].","abstract":"To estimate the prevalence of dental caries and treatment needs in 12-year-olds and adolescents.Cross-sectional study based on results from the epidemiological surveys: Oral Health Conditions in the State of Sao Paulo, 2002 and the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil) 2010. Secondary data for 5,782 (2002) and 369 (2010) 12-year-olds and 880 (2002) and 300 (2010) 15- to 19-year-olds were analyzed. Dental caries attack was evaluated using the DMFT (decayed, missing or filled teeth) index and the need for treatment verified using the criteria proposed by the World Health Organization. The Significant Caries Index was used to measure the severity of the decay in the tercile of the group with the highest prevalence of the disease. In order to analyze the results, the Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests were used, with a 5% significance.There was a decrease of 39.3 percentage points in the DMFT index for 12-year-olds (p < 0.001) and of 41.1 percentage points for the adolescents (p < 0.001) between 2002 and 2010, and an increase of around 161.0 and 303.0 percentage in the group which was free from dental caries respectively. The percentage of restored teeth decreased in both age groups, although the prevalence of dental caries did not change in the group more affected by dental caries. In the group with few dental caries, there was a decrease in the component 'tooth loss' for adolescents and increase in the component 'decayed teeth' for the 12-years-old and the adolescents. There was an increase in the need for dental treatment in the group as a whole and in the group of 12-year-olds more affected by dental caries; and among the adolescents, the need for restoration on two or more surface decreased in the group as a whole and also in the group which suffered least from dental caries.The decreasing need for non-complex treatment in adolescents suggests that promotion and prevention activities are having a positive effect on this group. Moreover, the two epidemiological surveys in the state of Sao Paulo show improvements in oral health conditions in both age groups studied and calls for monitoring aimed also at the group least affected by dental caries.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626581","annotations":[{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.938696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.861326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.353518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.346584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Sao Paulo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Paulo"},{"name":"State of Sao Paulo","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Sao_Paulo"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"782","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/782"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"303","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/880"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Percentage point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
