{"id":45410,"title":"Dual function of p38? MAPK in colon cancer: suppression of colitis-associated tumor initiation but requirement for cancer cell survival.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer is frequently associated with chronic inflammation, with the intestinal epithelial barrier playing an important protective role against the infections and injuries that cause colitis. The p38? pathway regulates inflammatory responses but can also suppress tumor initiation in epithelial cells. We have found that p38? signaling has a dual function in colorectal tumorigenesis. On one side, p38? protects intestinal epithelial cells against colitis-associated colon cancer by regulating intestinal epithelial barrier function. Accordingly, p38? downregulation results in enhanced colitis-induced epithelial damage and inflammation, which potentiates colon tumor formation. Surprisingly, inhibition of p38? in transformed colon epithelial cells reduces tumor burden. Thus, p38? suppresses inflammation-associated epithelial damage and tumorigenesis but contributes to the proliferation and survival of tumor cells.
