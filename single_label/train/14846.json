{"id":14846,"title":"Combined therapy of iron chelator and antioxidant completely restores brain dysfunction induced by iron toxicity.","abstract":"Excessive iron accumulation leads to iron toxicity in the brain; however the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigated the effects of iron overload induced by high iron-diet consumption on brain mitochondrial function, brain synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Iron chelator (deferiprone) and antioxidant (n-acetyl cysteine) effects on iron-overload brains were also studied.Male Wistar rats were fed either normal diet or high iron-diet consumption for 12 weeks, after which rats in each diet group were treated with vehicle or deferiprone (50 mg/kg) or n-acetyl cysteine (100 mg/kg) or both for another 4 weeks. High iron-diet consumption caused brain iron accumulation, brain mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired brain synaptic plasticity and cognition, blood-brain-barrier breakdown, and brain apoptosis. Although both iron chelator and antioxidant attenuated these deleterious effects, combined therapy provided more robust results.In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that combined iron chelator and anti-oxidant therapy completely restored brain function impaired by iron overload.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400127","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Synaptic plasticity","weight":0.745836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Chelation","weight":0.699086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.664488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.597532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.267908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Iron overload","weight":0.237908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
