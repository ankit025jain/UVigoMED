{"id":90477,"title":"Counselor-assisted problem solving improves caregiver efficacy following adolescent brain injury.","abstract":"The purpose of the current study is to examine the efficacy of Counselor-Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) in improving caregiver adaptation following traumatic brain injury (TBI).In a randomized clinical trial comparing CAPS (n = 65), an online problem-solving intervention with accompanying Web-based counseling sessions, with an information-based Internet Resource Comparison (IRC; n = 67) program, participants included families of 12- to 17-year-olds who had sustained a TBI in the past 6 months. Linear regression analyses were used to identify main effects and to examine whether caregiver education, race, or prior computer use moderated treatment efficacy.Computer experience moderated postintervention improvements in caregiving self-efficacy following CAPS, Specifically, parents in CAPS with low levels of prior use reporting the greatest improvements. CAPS participants who completed 5 or more sessions reported greater reductions in depression than did the IRC; however, the groups did not differ on global distress.Findings support the potential utility of counselor-supported Web-based interventions particularly for individuals with limited computer expertise following adolescent TBI.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611923","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.857868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Problem solving","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.615743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.42625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.377582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.333596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.3243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.16538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Computing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing"},{"name":"Linear algebra","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
