{"id":92450,"title":"Differentiating Kingella kingae septic arthritis of the hip from transient synovitis in young children.","abstract":"To conduct a retrospective multicenter study to assess the ability of a predictive algorithm to differentiate between children with Kingella kingae infection of the hip and those with transient synovitis.Medical charts of 25 Israeli and 9 Spanish children aged 6-27 months with culture-proven K kingae arthritis of the hip were reviewed, and information on the 4 variables included in the commonly used Kocher prediction algorithm (body temperature, refusal to bear weight, leukocytosis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was gathered.Patients with K kingae arthritis usually presented with mildly abnormal clinical picture and normal serum levels of or near-normal acute-phase reactants. Data on all 4 variables were available for 28 (82%) children, of whom 1 child had none, 6 children had 1, 13 children had 2, 5 had 3, and only 3 children had 4 predictors, implying ? 40% probability of infectious arthritis in 20 (71%) children.Because of the overlapping features of K kingae arthritis of the hip and transient synovitis in children younger than 3 years of age, Kocher predictive algorithm is not sensitive enough for differentiating between these 2 conditions. To exclude K kingae arthritis, blood cultures and nucleic acid amplification assay should be performed in young children presenting with irritation of the hip, even in the absence of fever, leukocytosis, or a high Kocher score.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217199","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.924931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.65248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.506583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.368951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Transient synovitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_synovitis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
