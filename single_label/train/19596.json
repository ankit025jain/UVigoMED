{"id":19596,"title":"Extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae: a threat from the kitchen.","abstract":"Food is an established source of extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Hand hygiene and cooking prevent transmission, but hands could be recontaminated by touching used cutting boards. ESBL-producing Escherichia coli were identified on 12% of cutting boards and 50% of gloves after poultry preparation, pointing to an important source for transmission.
