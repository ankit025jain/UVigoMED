{"id":54316,"title":"HOXA10 promotes cell invasion and MMP-3 expression via TGF?2-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in pancreatic cancer cells.","abstract":"HOXA10 is closely related to tumor progression in many human cancers. However, the role of HOXA10 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of HOXA10 in pancreatic cancer cell invasion and migration.The effect of HOXA10 on the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells was assessed by invasion and migration assays. The protein of transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF?2) was neutralized by TGF?2 blocking antibody. The activation of p38 was inhibited by SB239063.HOXA10 could promote the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of HOXA10 decreased the expressions of TGF?2 and matrix metallopeptidase-3 (MMP-3) and suppressed the activation of p38. Conversely, overexpression of HOXA10 increased the levels of TGF?2 and MMP-3. Further experiments identified that TGF?2 contributed to the HOXA10-promoted invasion and migration and regulated MMP-3 expression and p38 activation. Additionally, inhibition of p38 suppressed cell invasion and MMP-3 expression in pancreatic cancer cells.HOXA10 promotes cell invasion and MMP-3 expression of pancreatic cancer cells via TGF?2-p38 MAPK pathway. Thus, HOXA10 could be a useful target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464212","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"MMP1","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP1"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor beta","weight":0.811935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.758829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.745183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.742775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.574927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.573846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.259703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Hox gene","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_gene"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.195179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blocking antibody","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_antibody"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Beta decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"},{"name":"Electron configuration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
