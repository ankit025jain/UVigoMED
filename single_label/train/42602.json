{"id":42602,"title":"IL-6(-572/-597) polymorphism and expression in HBV disease chronicity in an Indian population.","abstract":"This study evaluated the association among IL-6(-572) and IL-6(-597) genotypes, haplotypes, mRNA, and protein levels with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in India.For this, 403 participants (153 controls, 61 inactive HBV-carriers, 65 chronic-active HBV patients, 63 HBV-cirrhotics, and 61 HBV-HCC participants) were enrolled in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), ELISA, and RT-PCR methods were used for assessing polymorphism, protein, and the mRNA levels, respectively, of IL-6.The study revealed that the IL-6(-572) GC genotype shared a positive association with hepatitis among controls, and a negative association with cirrhosis and consequent HCC development among carriers. However, the CC genotype shared a significant negative association with cirrhosis among controls and carriers. The IL-6(-597G>A), GA genotype acted as a potential protective factor for hepatitis, cirrhosis, and subsequent HCC development among carriers. The GA and CG haplotypes acted as a vital risk factor for HCC among controls and carriers. On the contrary, the CA haplotype was found to be a potential protective factor for HCC among carriers. Besides, the IL-6 levels significantly increased with cirrhosis development, as compared to carriers and hepatitis subjects.These preliminary findings indicate a potential role of IL-6(-572/-597) genotypes in HBV disease pathogenesis in an Indian population.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841049","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.703019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.679123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.662786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"India","weight":0.572189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.414337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.339581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.256245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Consequent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent"}]}
