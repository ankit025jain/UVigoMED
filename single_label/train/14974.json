{"id":14974,"title":"Effect of recombinant human MG53 protein on tourniquet-induced ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat muscle.","abstract":"Skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury (I-R) is a complex injury process that includes damage to the sarcolemmal membrane, contributing to necrosis and apoptosis. MG53, a muscle-specific TRIM family protein, has been shown to be essential for regulating membrane repair and has been shown to be protective against cardiac I-R and various forms of skeletal muscle injury. The purpose of this study was to determine if recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) administration offered protection against I-R.rhMG53 was administered to rats immediately before tourniquet-induced ischemia and again immediately before reperfusion. Two days later muscle damage was assessed histologically.rhMG53 offered no protective effect, as evidenced primarily by similar Evans blue dye inclusion in the muscles of rats administered rhMG53 or saline.Administration of rhMG53 does not offer protection against I-R in rat skeletal muscle. Additional studies are required to determine if the lack of a response is species-specific.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395153","annotations":[{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.689003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.438355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.214318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.174872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Sarcolemma","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcolemma"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Evans blue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_blue"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"}]}
