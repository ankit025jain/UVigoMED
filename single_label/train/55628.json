{"id":55628,"title":"Pigmented free-floating vitreous cyst.","abstract":"A 45-year-old man presented with a mobile shadow in the central visual field of his left eye for the preceding 4 months. His visual acuity was not affected. Funduscopy showed a brownish, oval-shaped structure floating in the vitreous cavity of the left eye. B-scan ultrasound demonstrated an oval-spherical hypoechogenic structure floating at the posterior pole. The absence of pertinent medical history and normal results from systemic exploration suggested a congenital etiology. The condition was observed regularly without any evidence of change. Differential diagnosis of vitreous cysts is important in order to establish an adequate therapeutic approach.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845723","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.568277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.554506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.475919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.197473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.191298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.149266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Posterior pole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_pole"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Shadow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 45","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_45"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
