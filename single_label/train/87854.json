{"id":87854,"title":"Assessment and treatment of children with cerebral palsy.","abstract":"Children with cerebral palsy are prone to development of musculoskeletal deformities. The underlying neurlogic insult may results in a loss of selective motor control, an increase in underlying muscle tone, and muscle imbalance, which can lead to abnormal deforming forces acting on the immature skeleton. The severely involved child is one who is at increased risk for developing progressive musculoskeletal deformities. Close surveillance and evaluation are key to addressing the underlying deformity and improving and maintaining overall function.
