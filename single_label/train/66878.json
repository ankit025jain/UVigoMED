{"id":66878,"title":"The effects of super-flux (high performance) dialyzer on plasma glycosylated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) and glycosylated N-Terminal proBNP in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis.","abstract":"Plasma BNP levels are predictive of prognosis in hemodialysis patients. However, recent studies showed that the current BNP immunoassay cross-reacts with glycosylated proBNP, and the NT-proBNP assay underestimates glycosylated NT-proBNP. In addition, the recently developed high performance dialyzer removes medium-sized molecular solutes such as ?2-microgloburin. We therefore investigated the effects of high performance dialysis on measured levels of glycosylated proBNP, glycosylated NT-proBNP and other BNP-related peptides in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis.The relationships between clinical parameters and BNP-related molecule were also investigated. We used our newly developed immunoassay to measure plasma total BNP and proBNP in 105 normal subjects and 36 ESRD patients before and after hemodialysis. Plasma NT-proBNP was measured using Elecsys II after treatment with or without deglycosylating enzymes. We also measured plasma ANP and cGMP using radioimmunoassays.All the measured BNP-related peptides were significantly higher in ESRD patients than healthy subjects. Total BNP (-38.9%), proBNP (-29.7%), glycoNT-proBNP (-45.5%), nonglycoNT-proBNP (-53.4%), ANP (-50.4%) and cGMP (-72.1%) were all significantly reduced after hemodialysis, and the magnitude of the reduction appeared molecular weight- dependent. Both the proBNP/total BNP and glycoNT-proBNP/nonglycoNT-proBNP ratios were increased after hemodialysis. The former correlated positively with hemodialysis vintage and negatively with systolic blood pressure, while the latter correlated positively with parathyroid hormone levels.These results suggest that hemodialysis using super-flux dialyzer removes BNP-related peptides in a nearly molecular weight-dependent manner. The ProBNP/total BNP and glycoNT-proBNP/nonglycoNT-proBNP ratios appear to be influenced by hemodialysis-related parameters in ESRD patients on hemodialysis.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667631","annotations":[{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.748581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Atrial natriuretic peptide","weight":0.704589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.644641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.612178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.500654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.441335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.441284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radioimmunoassay","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioimmunoassay"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.142337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Dialysis (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"}]}
