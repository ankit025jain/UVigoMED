{"id":55270,"title":"Glaucoma diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography parameters in early glaucoma with different types of optic disc damage.","abstract":"To compare the initial visual field (VF) defect pattern and the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters and investigate the effects of distinct types of optic disc damage on the diagnostic performance of these OCT parameters in early glaucoma.Retrospective, observational study.A total of 138 control eyes and 160 eyes with early glaucoma were enrolled. The glaucomatous eyes were subdivided into 4 groups according to the type of optic disc damage: focal ischemic (FI) group, myopic (MY) group, senile sclerotic (SS) group, and generalized enlargement (GE) group.The values of total deviation (TD) maps were analyzed, and superior-inferior (S-I) differences of TD were calculated. The optic nerve head (ONH) parameters, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses were measured.Comparison of diagnostic ability using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs).The S-I and central S-I difference of the FI group were larger than those of the GE group. The rim area of the SS group was larger than those of the 3 other groups, and the vertical cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) of the GE group was larger than that of the MY group. In addition, the minimum and inferotemporal GCIPL thicknesses of the FI group were smaller than those of the GE group. The AUC of the rim area (0.89) was lower than that of the minimum GCIPL (0.99) in the SS group, and the AUC of the vertical CDR (0.90) was lower than that of the minimum GCIPL (0.99) in the MY group. Furthermore, the AUCs of the minimum GCIPL thicknesses of the FI and MY group were greater than those of the average pRNFL thickness for detecting glaucoma, as opposed to the SS and GE.The OCT parameters differed among the 4 groups on the basis of the distinct optic disc appearance and initial glaucomatous damage pattern. Clinicians should be aware that the diagnostic capability of OCT parameters could differ according to the type of optic disc damage in early glaucoma.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Eye
