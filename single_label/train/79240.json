{"id":79240,"title":"Airway management in an infant with a giant vallecular cyst.","abstract":"Review vallecular cysts and report the surgical management of a vallecular cyst of unusual size with near-complete obliteration of the airway. This case report describes an unusually large mucus retention cyst in an 8-week-old infant that was diagnosed during induction of general anesthesia and prevented visualization of airway. Intubation was performed after rapid aspiration of the cyst contents.Vallecular cysts can present as a life-threatening obstruction in infants and complicate the establishment of an airway after induction of anesthesia. In our case, rapid thinking and aspiration of the cyst contents helped establish the airway for definitive CO2 laser excision.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462111","annotations":[{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.472889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.45968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.186848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
