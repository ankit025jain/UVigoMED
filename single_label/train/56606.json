{"id":56606,"title":"Molecular pathology of macrophages and interleukin-17 in age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"The pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells as well as by changes of choroidal capillaries in the macula. Although AMD is not a typical uveitis, there is a consistence and an imbalance of ocular para-inflammation. Ocular inflammation, particularly in the macula, plays a critical role in AMD pathogenesis. The inflammatory and immune-related elements involved in AMD include inflammatory and related cells as well as the secreted molecules and factors from these cells. Innate immune system elements such as macrophages and cytokines play an important role in AMD pathology and pathogenesis. This chapter reviews the observed deviation in macrophage plasticity and the elevated expression of interleukin-17 in AMD eyes while discussing potential contributions to AMD pathogenesis. Targeting of these specific inflammatory pathways and molecules at appropriate times should be explored and may become promising novel adjunct agents to AMD therapy.
