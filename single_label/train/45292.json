{"id":45292,"title":"Erroneous identification of APOBEC3-edited chromosomal DNA in cancer genomics.","abstract":"The revolution in cancer genomics shows that the dominant mutations are CG->TA transitions. The sources of these mutations are probably two host cell cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. The former in particular can access nuclear DNA and monotonously introduce phenomenal numbers of C->T mutations in the signature 5'TpC context. These can be copied as G->A transitions in the 5'GpA context.DNA hypermutated by an APOBEC3 enzyme can be recovered by a technique called 3DPCR, which stands for differential DNA denaturation PCR. This method exploits the fact that APOBEC3-edited DNA is richer in A+T compared with the reference. We explore explicitly 3DPCR error using cloned DNA.Here we show that the technique has a higher error rate compared with standard PCR and can generate DNA strands containing both C->T and G->A mutations in a 5'GpCpR context. Sequences with similar traits have been recovered from human tumour DNA using 3DPCR.Differential DNA denaturation PCR cannot be used to identify fixed C->T transitions in cancer genomes. Presently, the overall mutation frequency is ?10(4)-10(5) base substitutions per cancer genome, or 0.003-0.03?kb(-1). By contrast, the 3DPCR error rate is of the order of 4-20?kb(-1) owing to constant selection for AT DNA and PCR-mediated recombination. Accordingly, sequences recovered by 3DPCR harbouring mixed C->T and G->A mutations associated with the 5'GpC represent artefacts.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691422","annotations":[{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.821942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cytidine","weight":0.795868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytidine"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Denaturation (biochemistry)","weight":0.748124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nuclear DNA","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_DNA"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.713516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.578078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.518999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.216904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0458333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"APOBEC3G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APOBEC3G"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Revolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution"},{"name":"Identification (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(biology)"}]}
