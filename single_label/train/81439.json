{"id":81439,"title":"Anteriorly pedicled wide temporalis muscle flap with the minimum zygomatic osteotomy technique for post-discectomy temporomandibular joint arthroplasty.","abstract":"An anteriorly pedicled temporalis muscle flap has been shown to be a suitable interpositional material for the treatment of ankylosis and post-discectomy arthroplasty. The passage of the wide flap beneath the zygomatic arch into the joint space can be difficult owing to its bulk, causing excessive trauma to the vascularized pedicle. We describe the use of minimum zygomatic osteotomy without fixation for the passage of an anteriorly pedicled wide temporalis muscle flap for post-discectomy arthroplasty.
