{"id":56516,"title":"Late hyperbaric oxygen treatment of cilioretinal artery occlusion with nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion secondary to high altitude.","abstract":"To report a case of cilioretinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) after a journey to high altitude region and the use of late period hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy successfully.A previously healthy 48-year-old lowlander woman was admitted to our department for sudden blurred vision in her right eye started at 2 weeks prior to examination. The patient had a history of 1-month exposure to high altitude that finished a day before the onset of her complaints. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 10/20 in the right eye (RE) and 10/10 in the left eye. Fundus examination of the RE revealed whitening of the retina along the distribution of cilioretinal artery, sparing fovea, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and roth spots with minimally dilated and tortuous retinal veins. Visual field analysis revealed centrocecal scotoma. The patient was treated by a daily session of 2?h of HBO at 2.5 atmosphere absolute for 11 days. BCVA rised to a level of 20/20 for the RE and the scotomas were disappeared immediately after using of the HBO treatment.CRVO related CRAO should be regarded as a rare complication of exposure to high altitude and HBO seems to be the treatment of choice of high altitude related co-occurence of CRVO and CRAO in the late period.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Eye
