{"id":8173,"title":"Functional outcome after anal sphincter injury and treatment with mesenchymal stem cells.","abstract":"This research demonstrates the regenerative effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the injured anal sphincter by comparing anal sphincter pressures following intramuscular and serial intravascular MSC infusion in a rat model of anal sphincter injury. Fifty rats were divided into injury (n = 35) and no injury (NI; n = 15) groups. Each group was further divided into i.m., serial i.v., or no-treatment (n = 5) groups and followed for 5 weeks. The injury consisted of an excision of 25% of the anal sphincter complex. Twenty-four hours after injury, 5 Ã— 10(5) green fluorescent protein-labeled MSCs in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone (sham) were injected into the anal sphincter for i.m. treatment; i.v. and sham i.v. treatments were delivered daily for 6 consecutive days via the tail vein. Anal pressures were recorded before injury and 10 days and 5 weeks after treatment. Ten days after i.m. MSC treatment, resting and peak pressures were significantly increased compared with those in sham i.m. treatment (p < .001). When compared with the NI group, the injury groups had anal pressures that were not significantly different 5 weeks after i.m./i.v. treatment. Both resting and peak pressures were also significantly increased after i.m./i.v. MSC treatment compared with treatment with PBS (p < .001), suggesting recovery. Statistical analysis was done using paired t test with Bonferroni correction. Marked decrease in fibrosis and scar tissue was seen in both MSC-treated groups. Both i.m. and i.v. MSC treatment after injury caused an increase in anal pressures sustained at 5 weeks, although fewer cells were injected i.m. The MSC-treated groups showed less scarring than the PBS-treated groups, with the i.v. infusion group showing the least scarring.
