{"id":42471,"title":"Section 13. Short-course pretransplant antiviral therapy is a feasible and effective strategy to prevent hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation in genotype 2 patients.","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence in recipients who are viremic at time of liver transplantation (LT) is universal and carries poor prognosis. Pretransplant antiviral therapy to eradicate HCV reduces recurrence, but withdrawal rate is high. We conducted a short-course (4 weeks) of pegylated interferon alpha-2a (Peg-IFN-?2a) plus ribavirin (RBV) to prevent of HCV recurrence.From October 2009 to December 2011, eighty-eight consecutive HCV patients for living donor LT with potential living donor at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital were included. Patients were divided into treatment and nontreatment group depending on presence of HCV-RNA. Fixed dosage of Peg-IFN-?2a (135 ?g/week) plus RBV (10 mg/kg per day) were given for 4 weeks to treatment group who passed the 4-week waiting time according to clinical safety assessment.Forty-eight patients with genotypes 1, 2, and 3 (n=29/18/1) were treated with IFN and RBV combination for 4 (range, 1-9) weeks. Serum HCV RNA became undetectable at transplantation in 26 (54%) patients. No difference between genotypes 1 (n= 14, 48%) and 2/3(n=12, 63%, P=0.25) was observed. Most patients experienced cytopenia during treatment, but no mortality was noted. In the treatment group, 13 patients remained free of HCV infection 6 months after transplant. Virologic response at transplantation (48% vs. 100%, P=0.015) and genotype 2/3 (50% vs. 84%, P=0.01) are strong predictors of lower HCV recurrence rate. Multivariate analysis showed that genotype 2/3 was the only independent predictive factor affecting HCV RNA negativity 6 months after liver transplantation (OR:11.25; P=0.014).Short-term pretransplant antiviral therapy is a feasible strategy in preventing HCV recurrence after LDLT especially in genotypes 2 and 3 recipients.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24849835","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Interferon type I","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.663938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.639484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.230812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.18786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
