{"id":82757,"title":"The clinicopathologic significance of the expression of HLA-G in oral squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate HLA-G expression in primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) and potentially malignant lesions and to evaluate its relationship with clinicopathologic parameters.HLA-G expression in samples from patients with metastatic and nonmetastatic OCSCC (n = 60), potentially malignant lesions (n = 15), and clinically and histologically normal oral mucosa (n = 10) was characterized by immunohistochemistry. The density of CD8, CD83, and CD68 cells and Ki-67(+) and bcl-2(+) neoplastic cells were analyzed.HLA-G expression by neoplastic cells was significantly higher in metastatic OCSCC compared with nonmetastatic OCSCC (P = .01). Higher HLA-G expression was observed in OCSCC than in potentially malignant lesions (P = .006). Moreover, patients with lower HLA-G expression exhibited a tendency toward longer survival (22 months) compared with those with higher HLA-G expression (16 months).Our findings suggest that increased HLA-G expression in metastatic OCSCC may represent a tumor escape mechanism, which portends an unfavorable clinical prognosis.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528793","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.654509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.483491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"CD68","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD68"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
