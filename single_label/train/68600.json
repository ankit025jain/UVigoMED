{"id":68600,"title":"miR-192 induces G2/M growth arrest in aristolochic acid nephropathy.","abstract":"Aristolochic acid nephropathy is characterized by rapidly progressive tubulointerstitial nephritis culminating in end-stage renal failure and urothelial malignancy. Profibrotic effects of aristolochic acid are linked to growth arrest of proximal tubular epithelial cells; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely undetermined. miRNAs are small, endogenous, post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes. In the present study, we characterized the mechanism of aristolochic acid-induced cell cycle arrest and its regulation by miRNAs. Incubation with aristolochic acid led to profound G2/M arrest in proximal tubular epithelial cells via p53-mediated inactivation of the maturation-promoting complex, CDK1/cyclin-B1. Analysis of miRNA expression identified up-regulation of miRNAs, including miR-192, miR-194, miR-450a, and miR-542-3p. The stable overexpression of miR-192 recapitulated G2/M arrest via repression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, murine double-minute 2, a negative regulator of p53. p53-induced transcription of p21(cip1) and growth arrest and DNA damage 45 and resulted in the inactivation and dissociation of the maturation-promoting complex. These data demonstrate a core role for miR-192 in mediating proximal tubular epithelial cell G2/M arrest after toxic injury by aristolochic acid. Because numerous studies have linked such growth arrest to fibrosis after proximal tubular epithelial cell injury, this mechanism may have widespread relevance to recovery/nonrecovery after acute kidney injury.
