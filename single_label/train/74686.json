{"id":74686,"title":"Apathy and dementia. Nosology, assessment and management.","abstract":"Apathy, characterized by lack of motivation and loss of initiative, is a non-cognitive symptom that affects a high proportion, but not all, of patients with all forms of dementia. To explore the phenomenon of apathy in people with dementia, we searched the PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases for original research and review articles on apathetic behaviors in patients with dementia using the search terms \"apathy, behavioral and psychological symptoms, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Vascular dementia\". Some nosological aspects, neurobiological basis, and assessment of, as well as, potential benefits of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for apathy in dementia are discussed. Greater understanding of apathy will improve the identification, intervention, and treatment of this ubiquitous and pernicious syndrome.
