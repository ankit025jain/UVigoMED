{"id":87556,"title":"Functional evaluation of unstable distal radius fractures treated with an angle-stable volar T-plate.","abstract":"Evaluation of the levels of function, disability and quality of life of 23 patients with an unstable fracture of the distal radius treated with an angle-stable volar T-plate. During the period from 24/10/2004 to 01/02/2006 we carried out a prospective study including 23 patients. The fractures were 23A22 (n = 5), 23C11 (n = 4), 23C12 (n = 4) and 23C13 (n = 6). Impairment, disability and quality of life were evaluated 6 months after the injury. The evaluation of impairment included assessment of mobility of the wrist, global hand strength, key pinch strength and sensibility. There was an average loss of 0.715 for the Zscore of the grip strength and 0.531 for the Z-score of the key pinch strength. For sensibility, there was no significant difference between the fractured side and the uninjured side. The radiographs demonstrated a correction of volar tilt from -11.2 degrees to 4.9 degrees, of ulnar inclination from 14.3 degrees to 22.9 degrees, of radial shift from 19.9 mm to 16.8 mm, of radial length from 5.7 mm to 11.2 mm and of the RUI from -1.9 mm to 0.6 mm. The global DASH score was 55.7. The level of pain was 1.3 on the VAS. The mental SF-12 score was 48.4 and the physical SF-12 score 46.4. Treatment of unstable distal radius fractures with volar fixed-angle plates without additional bone graft led to good reduction of the fractures without significant secondary displacement.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Wounds and
