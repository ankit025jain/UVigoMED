{"id":44144,"title":"Endoscopic tissue shielding with polyglycolic acid sheets, fibrin glue and clips to prevent delayed perforation after duodenal endoscopic resection.","abstract":"The incidence of delayed perforation after endoscopic resection for superficial non-ampullary duodenal epithelial tumors is extremely high. Endoscopic tissue shielding with polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets and fibrin glue is a promising method to prevent delayed perforation after endoscopic resection in the duodenum. However, we often encounter difficulty when covering an artificial ulcer with PGA sheets after endoscopic resection. We report three cases of postoperative ulcers covered by PGA sheets, fibrin glue, and clips.
