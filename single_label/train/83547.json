{"id":83547,"title":"[Associations of PRLR/AluI gene polymorphism with reproductive, growth and meat quality traits in pigs].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine associations between genotypes for the prolactin receptor (PRLR) gene and swine reproductive, growth and meat traits. 210 sows of three genetic groups: Large White (LW), Danish Landrace (LD) and Landrace x Yorkshire x Duroc (L x x Y x D) were included. The studied reproductive traits included the total number of born (TNB), number born alive (NBA). The growth traits were the number of days to 100-kg, average daily gains (ADG). The meat traits were the average backfat thickness (BFT), half carcass weight (HCW), area of M. longissimus dorsi (MLT) and lean meat content (LM). The polymorphism was detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. It was shown that BB genotype is associated with the best NBA on 1.9 and 0.7 piglets at sows LW and LD, respectively. AB genotype is associated with best number of days to 100-kg at sows LD on 3.1 days and AA genotype with less BFT on 1.7 mm, bigger HCW on 0.5 kg and MLT on 5, 4 cm I at L x Y x D.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
