{"id":46332,"title":"[Comparative analysis of the efficacies of entecavir capsules and lamivudine in chronic hepatitis B patients].","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy profile of entecavir capsule (ETV) as a chronic hepatitis B therapy, as compared to lamivudine (LAM).In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group evaluation of ETV, 232 subjects were administered a 96-week course of 0.5 mg/day ETV or 100 mg/day LAM. PCR measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was conducted throughout the treatment course to determine achievement of complete virologic response (CVR; defined as less than 500 copies/ml of HBV DNA) or experience of virology rebound ( more than 500 copies/ml of HBV DNA after achievement of CVR).After week-48 of treatment, the ETV group showed a higher CVR rate (90.3% vs. LAM: 59.4%) and lower virology rebound rate (1.9% vs. LAM: 13.9%). After week-96 of treatment, the ETV group continued to have a higher CVR rate (86.0% vs. LAM: 71.4%), and virology rebound was experienced by significantly less subjects in the ETV group (1.2% vs. LAM: 11.9%, P = 0.005).ETV therapy can quickly and continuously suppress HBV replication in chronic hepatitis B patients, and has a lower resistance rate than LAM. Compared to LAM, ETV may be a superior long-term treatment choice for chronic hepatitis B.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636287","annotations":[{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.809718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.612303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.573606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.401398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Rebound rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_rate"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cockpit voice recorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit_voice_recorder"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Rebound effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Lactational amenorrhea method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactational_amenorrhea_method"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Parallel computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
