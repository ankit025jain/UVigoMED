{"id":36165,"title":"Topical clofibrate improves symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis and reduces serum TARC levels: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.","abstract":"Though topical corticosteroids (TC) are used for treating atopic dermatitis (AD) as a standard, there exist several problems including topical steroid addiction (TSA) or Red skin syndrome. Moreover, the number of patients, who refrain from using TC because of steroid-phobia, is increasing. Recently, topical PPAR alpha ligand application has been reported to improve experimental allergic dermatitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of topical clofibrate, one of PPAR alpha ligand, in such steroid-phobic patients with AD.This study was conducted as a double-blind design to investigate the effects of random administration of topical clofibrate and base (placebo) on skin manifestation and blood parameters of patients for 2 weeks. Severity was digitized using severity scoring systems for atopic dermatitis by the Japanese Dermatological Association (SSS-JDA) before and after two weeks. Subjective severity of patients was evaluated using visual analog scale (Pt-VAS). Serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) were also investigated.Twenty patients were enrolled, and 19 of 20 patients completed the study. In 19 patients, the value of severity score using SSS-JDA was decreased significantly after administration of topical clofibrate (P=0.001). Subjective evaluation using Pt-VAS (P=0.008) and serum TARC levels (P=0.03) were also significantly decreased after two weeks of topical clofibrate. There was not a significant difference in serum IgE levels. No adverse effect was observed.Topical clofibrate is useful for patients with AD especially who are reluctant to use topical steroids.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595568","annotations":[{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.657814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.630444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.550458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.140264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0842719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
