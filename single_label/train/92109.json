{"id":92109,"title":"Concurrent validity of the 10-meter walk test as compared with the 6-minute walk test in patients with spinal cord injury at various levels of ability.","abstract":"Cross-sectional design.To evaluate the concurrent validity of the 10-meter walk test (10MWT) as compared with the 6-minute walk test (6MinWT) in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) at various levels of walking ability, as determined using the criteria from the functional independence measure locomotor (FIM-L) scores.A major tertiary referral hospital in Thailand.Ninety-four independent ambulatory subjects with SCI (FIM-L scores 5-7) were assessed for their functional abilities using the 10MWT and 6MinWT.The data of the 10MWT and the 6MinWT had excellent correlation in subjects with FIM-L 7 (r=0.83, P<0.001), good correlation in subjects with FIM-L 6 (r=0.74, P<0.001), but poor correlation in subjects with FIM-L 5 (r=0.31, P>0.05).The 6MinWT is a thorough assessment to reflect functional endurance, but it requires a long time and a large area to administer. The findings confirm the utility of the 10MWT as an alternative monitoring tool to the 6MinWT, but only for the patients with rather good walking ability.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445972","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Concurrent validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_validity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Endurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"A major","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_major"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
