{"id":65648,"title":"A Valsalva leak-point pressure of >100?cmH2O is associated with greater success in AdVance™ sling placement for the treatment of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence.","abstract":"To determine if there is a Valsalva leak-point pressure (VLPP) threshold that predicts for retro-urethral transobturator sling (RTS) success in men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (UI).The preoperative urodynamic parameters of all patients undergoing RTS (AdVance™) sling surgery over the last 5 years were analysed and compared with the postoperative outcomes. The sling was defined as having been successful if the patient no longer had to wear pads or merely used a pad to provide a sense of security.In all, 46 men with a mean (range) age of 65 (45-83) years, underwent AdVance™ sling surgery. 10 men had undergone holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, one a transurethral resection of the prostate and 35 radical prostatectomy. 11 men had a VLPP of ?100?cmH2O. Of these 11 men, three had no, or minimal, improvement in their leakage and all three required a secondary procedure (artificial urinary sphincter, AUS). In the 35 men with a VLPP of >100 cmH2O there were three failures. One of these was successfully salvaged with a repeat sling, another with an AUS and one with ProACT™ balloons. The hazard ratio (HR) for failure with a VLPP of ?100?cmH20 compared with a VLPP of >100?cmH2O was 4 (95% confidence interval 0.68-23.7).A VLPP of >100?cmH2O has a high degree of predictability for success for AdVance™ sling placement for men with post-prostatectomy UI.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796275","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.782792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.598513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.577503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.509965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.39073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Holmium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmium"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Sanitary napkin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
