{"id":81013,"title":"Abdominal echinococcosis: outcomes of conservative surgery.","abstract":"Hydatid disease, infection with the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus spp., represents a substantial disease burden worldwide. We report here the outcomes of conservative surgery in patients with abdominal echinococcosis.We carried out a retrospective review of patients who underwent conservative surgery for abdominal hydatid disease during the period January 2008 to December 2011. Perioperative outcomes were analysed after a mean follow-up of 24 months (range 6-36 months).Thirty patients (mean age 40.4 years; male:female=7:3) underwent surgery. Most (29 patients) had a hepatic hydatid cyst and underwent partial cystectomy with omentoplasty; surgery was open in 22 cases (73%), laparoscopic in six cases (20%) and laparoscopic converted to open in one case (3%); one patient with a splenic cyst underwent open splenectomy. Cystobiliary communication was present in 10 cases (3%). Postoperative complications included transient biliary leak in two cases (7%), grade 1 surgical site infection in five cases (17%) and respiratory tract infection in three cases (10%), with no mortality. Mean hospital stay was 17 Â± 9.2 days. None of the patients had recurrence of disease on follow-up imaging.Conservative surgery offers an effective approach for abdominal echinococcosis, with minimal morbidity or recurrence, and is an alternative to radical procedures.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482136","annotations":[{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Cestoda","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.764704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.749944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.706565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.664316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.56145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.403423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.347452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
