{"id":62396,"title":"Prolyl hydroxylase domain-2 (PHD2) inhibition may be a better therapeutic strategy in renal anemia.","abstract":"Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has revolutionized the life of dialysis patients with anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Newer erythropoietin analogues with improved profile have been introduced recently. However, there are many concerns such as safety, economy and patient compliance with these newer rHuEPo analogues. Small molecules aimed to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase domain-2 (PHD2) may prevent degradation of hypoxia inducible factor-2 (HIF2) which leads to endogenous erythropoietin production. This therapeutic intervention may not only overcome the patient compliance and economic burden but also possibly overcome the safety issues related to rHuEPO and its analogues. Moreover, PHD2 inhibitors may increase the endogenous circulating iron availability via suppression of hepcidin, a master regulator of iron homeostasis which further reduces the need for exogenous intravenous iron administration for effective erythropoiesis in renal anemia patients. In conclusion, small molecule PHD2 inhibitors may have better therapeutic efficacy and potential to address clinical concerns associated with rHuEPO and rHuEPO mimetic peptides.
