{"id":46653,"title":"Intraoperative hypercarbia and massive surgical emphysema secondary to transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS).","abstract":"We describe a case where full-thickness excision of a rectal lesion caused massive surgical emphysema and subsequent hypercarbia with associated difficulties with ventilation. This unique case highlights the risks of respiratory failure with extraperitoneal insufflation as in this case and as more commonly with intraperitoneal insufflation. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS) is a technique that is being increasingly used in the management of large and early malignant rectal polyps. We reviewed the literature in order to understand the case and to highlight factors that should minimise any adverse sequelae. In the presence of ventilatory difficulties secondary to postoperative surgical emphysema, whether via extraperitoneal insufflation as described here or with intraperitoneal insufflation (as in laparoscopy), consider decreasing gas pressures, expediting the procedure, delaying extubation and prolonged close monitoring in recovery with possible admission to a high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU).
