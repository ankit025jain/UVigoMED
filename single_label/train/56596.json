{"id":56596,"title":"Genetic risk models in age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"Late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common sight-threatening disease of the central retina affecting approximately 1 in 30 Caucasians. Besides age and smoking, common genetic variants from at least 19 gene loci have reproducibly been associated with AMD likely explaining a large proportion of disease. Based on the current knowledge, several models were calculated to predict disease risk each with its own strength and weakness. Here, we review and compare published genetic risk models for AMD with or without additionally accounting for non-genetic factors.
