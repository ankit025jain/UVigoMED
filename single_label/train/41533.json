{"id":41533,"title":"Persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen in blood in a chronic haemodialysis patient following vaccination booster.","abstract":"Patients receiving haemodialysis are at an increased risk of hepatitis B infection; regular screening for incident infection and vaccination of susceptible individuals is recommended. Haemodialysis patients often require repeated high-dose hepatitis B vaccination boosters because of impaired response. Since the hepatitis B surface antigen is used as an immunogenic agent for vaccination and as a marker of hepatitis B infection, it has occasionally been detected in the blood shortly after vaccine administration and can be mistaken for a new infection. These transient results, however, are unlikely to persist for longer than 14?days after vaccination. We report the case of a haemodialysis patient who tested weakly positive for hepatitis B surface antigen 52?days after a vaccine booster. This is the longest vaccine-induced antigenaemia described in the literature and indicates that vaccination can cause weakly positive hepatitis B surface antigen results for longer than previously reported.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916976","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B vaccine","weight":0.632167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_vaccine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.321289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.224118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Weak interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Migrant worker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
