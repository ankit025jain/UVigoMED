{"id":51359,"title":"Gut hormone pharmacology of a novel GPR119 agonist (GSK1292263), metformin, and sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes mellitus: results from two randomized studies.","abstract":"GPR119 receptor agonists improve glucose metabolism and alter gut hormone profiles in animal models and healthy subjects. We therefore investigated the pharmacology of GSK1292263 (GSK263), a selective GPR119 agonist, in two randomized, placebo-controlled studies that enrolled subjects with type 2 diabetes. Study 1 had drug-naive subjects or subjects who had stopped their diabetic medications, and Study 2 had subjects taking metformin. GSK263 was administered as single (25-800 mg; n = 45) or multiple doses (100-600 mg/day for 14 days; n = 96). Placebo and sitagliptin 100 mg/day were administered as comparators. In Study 1, sitagliptin was co-administered with GSK263 or placebo on Day 14 of dosing. Oral glucose and meal challenges were used to assess the effects on plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). After 13 days of dosing, GSK263 significantly increased plasma total PYY levels by ? five-fold compared with placebo, reaching peak concentrations of ? 50 pM after each of the three standardized meals with the 300 mg BID dose. Co-dosing of GSK263 and metformin augmented peak concentrations to ? 100 pM at lunchtime. GSK263 had no effect on active or total GLP-1 or GIP, but co-dosing with metformin increased post-prandial total GLP-1, with little effect on active GLP-1. Sitagliptin increased active GLP-1, but caused a profound suppression of total PYY, GLP-1, and GIP when dosed alone or with GSK263. This suppression of peptides was reduced when sitagliptin was co-dosed with metformin. GSK263 had no significant effect on circulating glucose, insulin, C-peptide or glucagon levels. We conclude that GSK263 did not improve glucose control in type 2 diabetics, but it had profound effects on circulating PYY. The gut hormone effects of this GPR119 agonist were modulated when co-dosed with metformin and sitagliptin. Metformin may modulate negative feedback loops controlling the secretion of enteroendocrine peptides.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699248","annotations":[{"name":"Glucagon","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.801771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Negative feedback","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.705518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"GlaxoSmithKline","weight":0.678393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.335115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Peptide YY","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_YY"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Gastric inhibitory polypeptide","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Enteroendocrine cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
