{"id":86292,"title":"[Role of epidermal growth factor receptor expression level in cetuximab cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect against A549 lung cancer cell line].","abstract":"To investigate the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression level in cetuximab cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect against A549 lung cancer cell line.A549 cell line and NKTm cells were used as the target cell and the effector cell, respectively. pEGFR-EGFP plasmids were transfected into A549 cells by nucleofector method. EGFR expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry. The ADCC activity induced by cetuximab was assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay.A549 cells transfected with pEGFR-EGFP plasmids expressed higher level of EGFR protein on membrane and were more sensitive to ADCC activity mediated by cetuximab (P<0.05). The inhibition rate of A549 cells showed no significant difference between transfection group and wild-type group when treated with cetuximab alone (P> 0.05).EGFR expression level influences the sensitivity of A549 lung cancer cell line to ADCC activity mediated by cetuximab but not to cetuximab alone.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791796","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cetuximab","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetuximab"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.74952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.582528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.580956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.528324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.406983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity","weight":0.337978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_cell-mediated_cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.225011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"}]}
