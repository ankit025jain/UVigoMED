{"id":1157,"title":"The palliative care in heart failure trial: rationale and design.","abstract":"The progressive nature of heart failure (HF) coupled with high mortality and poor quality of life mandates greater attention to palliative care as a routine component of advanced HF management. Limited evidence exists from randomized, controlled trials supporting the use of interdisciplinary palliative care in HF.PAL-HF is a prospective, controlled, unblinded, single-center study of an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention in 200 patients with advanced HF estimated to have a high likelihood of mortality or rehospitalization in the ensuing 6 months. The 6-month PAL-HF intervention focuses on physical and psychosocial symptom relief, attention to spiritual concerns, and advanced care planning. The primary end point is health-related quality of life measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy with Palliative Care Subscale score at 6 months. Secondary end points include changes in anxiety/depression, spiritual well-being, caregiver satisfaction, cost and resource utilization, and a composite of death, HF hospitalization, and quality of life.PAL-HF is a randomized, controlled clinical trial that will help evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of palliative care in advanced HF using a patient-centered outcome as well as clinical and economic end points.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25440791","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.806541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.655185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.63097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.619073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.574053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.537356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.489893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.267242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.265572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Kansas","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0575019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Health maintenance organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_maintenance_organization"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Kansas City, Missouri","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri"}]}
