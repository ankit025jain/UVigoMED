{"id":45568,"title":"Reduced hTERT protein levels are associated with DNA aneuploidy in the colonic mucosa of patients suffering from longstanding ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"Longstanding ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease of chronic inflammation of the colon. It is associated with the development of colorectal cancer through a multistep process including increasing degrees of dysplasia and DNA-ploidy changes. However, not all UC patients will develop these characteristics even during lifelong disease, and patients may therefore be divided into progressors who develop dysplasia or cancer, and non-progressors who do not exhibit such changes. In the present study, the amount of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase, was estimated by using peroxidase immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a set of progressor and non-progressor UC colectomies. The protein levels in the colonic mucosa of the progressors and non?progressors were compared, and further comparisons between different categories of dysplastic development and to DNA-ploidy status within the progressors were made. Levels of hTERT were elevated in the colonic mucosa of the progressors and non-progressors when compared to non-UC control samples, but no difference was observed between the hTERT levels in the mucosa of progressors and non-progressors. The levels of hTERT associated with levels of Ki67 to a significant degree within the non-progressors. hTERT expression in lesions with DNA-aneuploidy were decreased as compared to diploid lesions, when stratified for different classes of colonic morphology. Our results indicate an association between hTERT protein expression and aneuploidy in UC-progressor colons, and also a possible protective mechanism in the association between hTERT and Ki67, against development of malignant features within the mucosa of a UC-colon.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676865","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Telomerase","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.872643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.799186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.748983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.674363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.449784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Telomerase reverse transcriptase","weight":0.365969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.339412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.281821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.0929427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
