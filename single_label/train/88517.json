{"id":88517,"title":"Retrospective analysis of 4 years of clinical experience with transdermal buprenorphine (Transtec) in post-traumatic pain.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of transdermal buprenorphine (BTDS) in the treatment of post-traumatic pain in a working population.Retrospective case series of patients with severe post-traumatic pain treated with BTDS between 2008 and 2012.57 patients were evaluated: 38 men, 19 women (mean age 43 years); patients with burns (n = 22), skin degloving (14), open dislocations (eight), traumatic nerve lesions (six), spinal cord injury (four) and limb amputations (three). 25, 12 and 20 patients experienced neuropathic pain, nociceptive pain or neuropathic/nociceptive pain, respectively. The mean baseline DN4 questionnaire and pain intensity scores were 4.8±2.3 and 7.4±1.5, respectively. The mean duration of pain before BTDS use was 24.4 months (>3 months in 65% of patients). Total patient-years of BTDS treatment were 73. After 14.7±14.9 months of BTDS treatment, mean pain intensity was reduced by 4.2±2.2 points, 38 patients (66.7%) had ?50% pain relief, 69% reported functional improvement, especially in gait ability (25) and activities of daily life (14), and 46 patients (80.7%) had improved sleep quality. The starting dose of BTDS was 4.4-17.5 ?g/h; maintenance dose was 8.8-70 ?g/h. At the start of BTDS treatment, all patients used a total of 187 concomitant analgesics daily, 72% of which were stopped during treatment with BTDS; the number of patients that could be managed exclusively with BTDS and rescue analgesia increased to 31%. 13 patients (22%) presented nausea, eight constipation, six local skin reactions, three vomiting and somnolence, and two patients experienced dizziness. Four patients (6.9%) stopped BTDS due to adverse reactions.BTDS is an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of patients with severe post-traumatic pain, reducing the intensity of pain and improving functional capacity and quality of sleep.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835268","annotations":[{"name":"Buprenorphine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.844261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.502841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Transdermal","weight":0.461308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.40582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0635026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Methaqualone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methaqualone"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
