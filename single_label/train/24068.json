{"id":24068,"title":"Late-onset Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in solid organ transplant recipients.","abstract":"Anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis is recommended for at least 6-12 months after solid organ transplantation, as most cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) occur during the first year post transplantation. Herein, we report 4 cases of late-onset PCP (>1 year post transplant). PCP appeared in a range of 50-68 months post transplant. Two cases had history of humoral rejection episodes treated with rituximab, and the other 2 had low CD4+ T-cell count (<200 cells/mm(3) ) at the time of diagnosis. All 4 patients survived. In conclusion, although the number of cases is low, we must be aware of the possibility of late-onset PCP in solid organ transplant patients. The role of previous use of rituximab or persistent CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia should be addressed in future studies.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456244","annotations":[{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.702265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Pneumocystis jirovecii","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_jirovecii"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.598826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Pneumocystis pneumonia","weight":0.468384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_pneumonia"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.42868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.394288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymphocytopenia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytopenia"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Re Saul D Harrison & Sons plc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re_Saul_D_Harrison_&_Sons_plc"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
