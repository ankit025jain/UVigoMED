{"id":88839,"title":"Rapunzel syndrome: diagnosis via radiograph and history.","abstract":"Rapunzel syndrome is defined as a gastric trichobezoar with a tail that extends distally into the small intestine. It is extremely rare and found more often in premenarchal girls with psychiatric comorbidities. Symptoms can be vague and linger for years. However, prolonged intake of indigestible material can lead to gastric outlet obstruction, which may present similarly to a small bowel obstruction. The standard imaging modality of choice to make a presurgical diagnosis is via computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen. However, the risk of radiation-induced malignancy associated with a CT scan is an important consideration when managing children. We report a case of Rapunzel syndrome in a 6-year-old girl who was diagnosed presurgically without the use of a CT scan.
