{"id":55503,"title":"High-frequency radiowave electrosurgery for persistent conjunctival chemosis following cosmetic blepharoplasty.","abstract":"Conjunctival chemosis often complicates cosmetic lower eyelid blepharoplasty. With the conventional approaches, including medical or surgical methods, irritative symptoms are produced and complete recovery is delayed. The authors introduced a new simple surgical approach for treating persistent conjunctival chemosis following cosmetic blepharoplasty.Eleven patients (12 eyes) with persistent chemosis lasting 6 weeks to 2 years were recruited for this study. Subconjunctival coagulation on the edematous conjunctiva was performed with a fine-needle electrode using a high-frequency radiowave electrosurgical unit in coagulation mode, and subconjunctival fluid drainage was performed by gentle pressure with a wet applicator. After the procedures, topical steroid and antibiotic eye drops were given four times per day for 1 month.Chemosis in 11 eyes (91.7 percent) was resolved within 1 week and remained stable for a follow-up period of 6 months. Recurrence of chemosis and complications related to the procedure were not noted during the follow-up.A surgical approach with high-frequency radiowave electrosurgery produced a significant reduction of persistent chemosis and provided prompt symptom improvement. This procedure can be considered as a simple and safe method of treating persistent conjunctival chemosis following cosmetic blepharoplasty.Therapeutic, IV.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867715","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.824218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.773873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.711596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.629896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.303648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.211358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Blepharoplasty","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blepharoplasty"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Chemosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosis"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
