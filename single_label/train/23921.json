{"id":23921,"title":"[Changes in serum pepsinogen in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertensive gastropathy].","abstract":"To determine serum pepsinogen levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and investigate the functions of the gastric mucosa in these patients with concurrent portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG).Fifty-one patients with liver cirrhosis and 22 healthy controls were studied by gastroscopy. The hepatic function of the patients with or without PHG were evaluated with Child-Pugh grade. Helicobacter pylori infection was detected using rapid urease test or exhalation of carbon 13. The serum pepsinogen I and II levels were tested by latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetry to calculate the PGI/PGII ratio (PGR).In cirrhotic patients, the levels of serum PGI and PGR were lower than those in the healthy controls. The patients without PHG had a serum PGI level of 49.48+23.86 µg/L, significantly lower than that in PHG patients (74.85+30.27 µg/L, P=0.000). The levels of serum PG II in patients with H.pylori infection was significantly higher that in patients free of H.pylori infection (P=0.003).The serum level of PGI decreases obviously in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and PHG, who can have damages of the gastric mucosa lamina propria and reduced secretory function of the gastric mucosa. H.pylori infection may affect the level of PGII. There is no significant correlation between serum PG level and liver function, but to a certain extent, serum PG level especially PGI can reflect the function of gastric mucosa in patients of liver cirrhosis.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463137","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.889499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Pepsin","weight":0.617389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.61114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.504832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Carbon-13","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-13"},{"name":"Portal hypertensive gastropathy","weight":0.441017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertensive_gastropathy"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Prostacyclin","weight":0.171108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostacyclin"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
