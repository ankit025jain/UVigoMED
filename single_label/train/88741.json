{"id":88741,"title":"Foreign body granulomatous reaction associated with polyethelene 'Fiberwire(®)' suture material used in Achilles tendon repair.","abstract":"Repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture is a common procedure. There are many accepted surgical techniques; suture selection is largely due to surgeon preference. We present a case report of a granulomatous reaction to suture material following Achilles tendon repair. 'Fiberwire(®)' is an increasingly popular suture material for the repair of tendons and ligamentous structures; the polyethelene braided structure with silicone and polyester coating provides high tensile strengths and good handling characteristics. Eight months following uneventful Achilles tendon repair surgery in an otherwise fit and well patient, pain, swelling and loss of function was noted. She required revision surgery with debridement and reconstruction of the tendo Achillis with flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer. Histology revealed a granulomatous reaction with giant cell response surrounding sections of the suture. Both the silicone coating of Fiberwire(®) and polyethylene core have the potential to cause a severe granulomatous reaction. We would advise caution in the use of this suture for tendo Achillis repair, and use the readily available alternatives.
