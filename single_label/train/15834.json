{"id":15834,"title":"Growing the seeds sown by Piero Sensi.","abstract":"Piero Sensi is probably known primarily for his role in the discovery of rifamycin and for developing it to be a drug of fundamental importance in the treatment of tuberculosis. He has also contributed to promote screening programs of microbial products and research approaches for antibacterial agents that have been further developed up to the present day. This paper reports a sequence of discovery approaches, failures and successes that spans for about 50 years and is still in progress.
