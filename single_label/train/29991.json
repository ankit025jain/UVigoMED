{"id":29991,"title":"Aptamer and its potential applications for food safety.","abstract":"Accompanied by industrial globalization, rapid urbanization, and population increment, mass production and staple trading for food consumption are upsoaring continuously, foodborne disease resulted from various food safety issues is currently a crucial public health concern worldwide, which has not only created a great burden on both economy and society, but also greatly threatened the sustainability of mankind's livelihood and human reproduction. In order to better ensure food safety and thus effectively curb the occurrence of foodborne diseases, the development and evolving of inspection strategies are indispensable measures for quality assurance and conformity assessment. Nowadays, as complementary measures to and with advantageous merits over classic analytical methods, highly specific and selective aptamer-based assays have found their increasingly important roles in various domains of food analysis. This critical review summarizes the advantages of aptamer as compared with antibody, introduces important evolving variants of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), and presents an overview of potential aptamer applications for food safety.
