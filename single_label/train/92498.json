{"id":92498,"title":"The role of radiology in the evolution of the understanding of articular disease.","abstract":"Both the clinical practice of radiology and the journal Radiology have had an enormous effect on our understanding of articular disease. Early descriptions of osteoarthritis (OA) appeared in Radiology. More recently, advanced physiologic magnetic resonance (MR) techniques have furthered our understanding of the early prestructural changes in patients with OA. Sodium imaging, delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage, and spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame (or T1?) sequences have advanced understanding of the pathophysiology and pathoanatomy of OA. Many pioneering articles on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) also have been published in Radiology. In the intervening decades, our understanding of the natural history of RA has been altered by these articles. Many of the first descriptions of crystalline arthropathies, including gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition, and hydroxyapatite deposition disease, appeared in Radiology.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340431","annotations":[{"name":"Gout","weight":0.910201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.705873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.686856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.520827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Calcium pyrophosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_pyrophosphate"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Arthropathy","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropathy"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Royal Academy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy"},{"name":"Deposition (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(geology)"},{"name":"Rotating reference frame","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_reference_frame"},{"name":"Framing (construction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(construction)"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"}]}
