{"id":29125,"title":"Implementing substance abuse group therapy clinical trials in real-world settings: challenges and strategies for participant recruitment and therapist training in the Women's Recovery Group Study.","abstract":"Open-enrollment group therapy research is challenged by the participant recruitment necessary to ensure continuous group enrollment. We present successful strategies to overcome the following barriers during the Women's Recovery Group (WRG) two-site clinical trial (N?=?158): maintenance of sample size and balanced gender randomization during continuous enrollment, maintenance of group attendance, and training and retention of therapists over the 24-month continuous group enrollment.To increase recruitment, we targeted referral sources yielding the highest enrollment conversion at each site. Group sessions were consistently held regardless of group size. Therapists were trained in two teams allowing for coverage and uninterrupted treatment over 24 months.At both sites recruitment and enrollment increased with each successive quarter. Sample size and end date targets were met without disruptions in treatment. Group therapists reported high satisfaction with their training and treatment experiences.These strategies supported targeted enrollment and study duration, stability of open-enrollment group therapy frame, and therapist retention and satisfaction.Applying these strategies can aid in providing evidence-based group therapy in both clinical and research settings.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724875","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.519795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.313174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Proselytism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselytism"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Wargames Research Group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargames_Research_Group"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Recovery (Eminem album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_(Eminem_album)"},{"name":"Topological group","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Group size measures","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_size_measures"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"}]}
