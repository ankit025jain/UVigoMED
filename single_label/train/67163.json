{"id":67163,"title":"Long-term results of permanent memotherm urethral stent in the treatment of recurrent bulbar urethral strictures.","abstract":"To evaluate the long term outcomes of permanent Memotherm urethral stent in the treatment of recurrent bulbar urethral stricture.Twenty patients who underwent permanent Memotherm urethral stent implantation due to recurrent bulbar urethral stricture following previous unsuccessful surgical procedure from 1996 to 2002 were included in the study. Long-term outcomes of the patients were evaluated.The overall success rate was 87.5% at the end of the tenth year. There was discomfort in implantation area in eight patients about 1 month following the procedure. These patients were treated with alpha-blocker and anti-inflammatory drugs. Stone formation was observed at the urethral stent implantation area in two patients. Post-void dripping has been observed in 15 patients up to the postoperative 3rd month. Stress urinary incontinence was observed in a patient with a 1-year follow-up. Partial stent migration was observed in two patients. None of the patients experienced pain during erection.Memotherm urethral stent is a minimal invasive surgical procedure which can be safely and effectively used in patients with recurrent urethral stricture.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642153","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.760106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.678518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.489611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Corticobulbar tract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticobulbar_tract"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dripping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dripping"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
