{"id":86263,"title":"?5 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediates nicotine-induced HIF-1? and VEGF expression in non-small cell lung cancer.","abstract":"By binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), nicotine induces the proliferation and apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies have indicated that ?5-nAChR is highly associated with lung cancer risk and nicotine dependence. However, the mechanisms through which ?5-nAChRs may influence lung carcinogenesis are far from clear. In the present study, we investigated the roles of ?5-nAChR in the nicotine-induced expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of ?5-nAChR and HIF-1? in 60 specimens of lung cancer and para-carcinoma tissue. The correlations between the expression levels of ?5-nAChR and HIF-1? and other clinicopathological data were analyzed. In a cell line that highly expressed ?5-nAChR, the loss of ?5-nAChR function by siRNA was used to study whether ?5-nAChR is involved in the nicotine-induced expression of HIF-1? and VEGF through the activation of the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Cell growth was detected using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). ?5-nAChR (78.3%) and HIF-1? (88.3%) were both overexpressed in NSCLC, and their expression levels were found to be correlated with each other (P<0.05). In the A549 cell line, ?5-nAChR and HIF-1? were found to be expressed under normal conditions, and their expression levels were significantly increased in response to nicotine treatment. The silencing of ?5-nAChR significantly inhibited the nicotine-induced cell proliferation compared with the control group and attenuated the nicotine-induced upregulation of HIF-1? and VEGF, and these effects required the cooperation of the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. These results show that the ?5-nAChR/HIF-1?/VEGF axis is involved in nicotine-induced tumor cell proliferation, which suggests that ?5-nAChR may serve as a potential anticancer target in nicotine-associated lung cancer.
