{"id":82058,"title":"Recurrent aphthous stomatitis and pain management with low-level laser therapy: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to determine whether low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has an analgesic effect in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS).A randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted with LLLT (wavelength, 809 nm; power, 60 mW; pulse frequency, 1800 Hz; duration, 80 seconds per treatment; dose, 6.3 J/cm(2)) in 40 patients with RAS. The intervention group was treated with LLLT on 3 occasions, with a 1-day interval. The control group was treated similarly, without any laser power. Pain perception (visual analog scale [VAS] rating) and patients' experience of eating, drinking, and brushing teeth was registered.VAS rating decreased (day 0 until day 2) from 84.7 to 31.5 (LLLT) and from 81.7 to 76.1 (placebo) (P < .0001). LLLT also relieved the difficulty of drinking, eating, and brushing teeth.LLLT reduced the pain and the inconvenience of eating, drinking, and brushing teeth for patients with RAS, compared with placebo.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725989","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.733472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.51043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.433706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Aphthous ulcer","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_ulcer"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.233214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.15009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.14551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Stomatitis","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatitis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.0544569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Low level laser therapy","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_level_laser_therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1800","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Watt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"}]}
