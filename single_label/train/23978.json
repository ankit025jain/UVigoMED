{"id":23978,"title":"Detection of Escherichia fergusonii by PCR-based DNA sequencing in a case of delayed-onset chronic endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.","abstract":"We report a case of chronic low-grade endophthalmitis after cataract surgery presenting with recurrent episodes of severe anterior chamber reactions and hypopyon uveitis caused by Escherichia fergusonii, which was isolated from vitreous aspirate by polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction has emerged as an essential, powerful, and rapid laboratory diagnostic technique and a useful adjunct to the conventional gold standard.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461505","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.770581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.68449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Hypopyon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopyon"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
