{"id":55219,"title":"Refractive accuracy with light-adjustable intraocular lenses.","abstract":"To evaluate efficacy, predictability, and stability of refractive treatments using light-adjustable intraocular lenses (IOLs).University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial.Eyes with a light-adjustable IOL (LAL) were treated with spatial intensity profiles to correct refractive errors. The effective changes in refraction in the light-adjustable IOL after every treatment were estimated by subtracting those in the whole eye and the cornea, which were measured with a Hartmann-Shack sensor and a corneal topographer, respectively. The refractive changes in the whole eye and light-adjustable IOL, manifest refraction, and visual acuity were obtained after every light treatment and at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.The study enrolled 53 eyes (49 patients). Each tested light spatial pattern (5 spherical; 3 astigmatic) produced a different refractive change (P<.01). The combination of 2 light adjustments induced a maximum change in spherical power of the light-adjustable IOL of between -1.98 diopters (D) and +2.30 D and in astigmatism of up to -2.68 D with axis errors below 9 degrees. Intersubject variability (standard deviation) ranged between 0.10 D and 0.40 D. The 2 required lock-in procedures induced a small myopic shift (range +0.01 to +0.57 D) that depended on previous adjustments.Light-adjustable IOL implantation achieved accurate refractive outcomes (around emmetropia) with good uncorrected distance visual acuity, which remained stable over time. Further refinements in nomograms and in the treatment's protocol would improve the predictability of refractive and visual outcomes with these IOLs.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957429","annotations":[{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.858433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.759633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.580126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.537655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.533361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.528555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.450431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Emmetropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmetropia"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
