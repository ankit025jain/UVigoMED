{"id":50404,"title":"[Differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in Jewish and Bedouin patients].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the Jewish and Bedouin populations.A retrospective analysis was conducted of hospital admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis in adult patients between 2003 and 2010. The clinical and biochemical characteristics and outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis patients of Jewish origin were compared with those of Bedouin origin. The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality.The study cohort included 220 consecutive patients for whom the admission diagnosis was diabetic ketoacidosis. The cohort was categorized according to Jewish and Bedouin origin as follows: 177 (80.5%) Jewish and 43 (19.5%) Bedouin patients. The Jewish patients were significantly older than the Bedouin patients (45.8 +/- 18.9 vs. 32.9 +/- 15.3, p < 0.001). The majority of the patients with diabetic ketoacidosis in both the Jewish and Bedouin groups had type 1 diabetes mellitus. No differences were found for in-hospital mortality, 30 days mortality or complication rates in groups of Jewish and Bedouin patients. The Length of hospital stay was significantly Longer in the Jewish compared to the Bedouin groups of patients (median 4 days (IQR 2; 6 days) vs. median 3 days (IQR 2; 4 days) respectively, p = 0.05).We did not find significant differences in the outcomes between Bedouin and Jewish patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. The Bedouin patients in the present study were younger compared to Jewish patients and the Length of the hospital stay was shorter in the Bedouin compared to the Jewish group. Advanced age, mechanical ventilation and bed-ridden state were independent predictors of 30-day mortality in both ethnic groups.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791549","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.731409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.666104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bedouin","weight":0.480845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.386474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Diabetic ketoacidosis","weight":0.316559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Judaism","weight":0.251406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism"},{"name":"Ketoacidosis","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Jews","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Vowel length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Longer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longer"},{"name":"Sovereign state","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state"}]}
