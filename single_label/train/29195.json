{"id":29195,"title":"Gabapentin for the treatment of substance use disorders.","abstract":"The amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Four placebo-controlled studies found the GABA analog drug gabapentin effective for treating alcohol dependence. Gabapentin may also be effective for treating alcohol withdrawal syndromes. One placebo-controlled pilot study found gabapentin beneficial for cannabis dependence, but several controlled studies found no benefit for cocaine or methamphetamine dependence. Whether gabapentin is effective for other substance use disorders is unknown.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712024","annotations":[{"name":"Gabapentin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.800924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.621052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.45191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.4092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.355432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.322917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.184057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Television pilot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot"}]}
