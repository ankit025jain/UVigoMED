{"id":69540,"title":"[Automated decision making support system for urologists on the prediction and the prevention of stone formation in urolithiasis].","abstract":"This article describes a decision making support system for urologists on the prediction and management of preventive interventions for urolithiasis using fuzzy logic decision-making device. Dictionary of informative signs and alphabet of classes are formed. The formulas for calculating the membership functions according to the known features are developed; these formulas allow to calculate the certainty factors for pertaining of inspected object to the desired class by means of iterative rules of rule of logical inference. Based on comparison of the values obtained with the threshold certainty factors, dephasification of conclusion is produced. In accordance with the obtained decision rules, control algorithm for the prevention measures in urolithiasis is developed. To test the effectiveness of \"operation\" of the synthesized decision rules, the certainty factors were calculated or 200 patients with urolithiasis, which were divided into two groups according to the results of observation during the year depending on the presence of recurrence. The analysis of the intersection of histograms of distribution of coefficient values showed high diagnostic efficiency (0.94) of synthesized decision rules.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437234","annotations":[{"name":"Fuzzy logic","weight":0.878434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Logic","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Decision theory","weight":0.737682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Expert system","weight":0.694979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Iteration","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.329879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Histogram","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram"},{"name":"Well-formed formula","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Intersection (set theory)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Alphabet","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Urolithiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolithiasis"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Certainty","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"List of rock formations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rock_formations"},{"name":"Membership function (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membership_function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Synthesizer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Sign (semiotics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)"}]}
