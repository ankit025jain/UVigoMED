{"id":29968,"title":"A case of fixed drug eruption secondary to quinine in tonic water presenting to a sexual health clinic.","abstract":"Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a cutaneous drug reaction which occurs repeatedly at a given mucocutaneous site after exposure to the causative agent. Lesions typically occur on extremities, oral mucosa and genital skin. Quinine is a common food additive and is recognised as a rare cause of FDE. We report a case of FDE with oral and genital lesions presenting to a sexual health clinic due to quinine contained in tonic water.
