{"id":18639,"title":"Evaluation of nosocomial blood stream infections caused by Pseudomonas species in newborns.","abstract":"Nosocomial blood stream infections (NBSI) are a significant hazard in health care facilities, exacting a tremendous toll and causing increased morbidity, mortality, and increased length of hospital stay and health care costs.In this article, we report the results of a retrospective cohort study to describe the epidemiology of pseudomonas NBSI in infants admitted to one Turkish neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during the 5-year period 2006-2010. In this period, Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the blood cultures of 28 patients.Pseudomonas putida (n = 12) was a causative microorganism at 42.8% of these infants, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 9) was determined in 32%. Sixty-five percent (n = 18) of the infants were below 32 weeks. The median age at diagnosis was 7 days (4-16). Mechanical ventilation (> 48 hours) rate was 89.2% (n = 25) and umbilical catheterization rate (> 48 hours) was 29.2% (n = 9). Imipenem resistance was detected in 53.5% (n = 15) of all cases. Median length of hospital stay was 15 days (8-29) with a mortality rate of 28%. Five of the infants who died had associated disorders such as Di George syndrome, anal atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and respiratory distress syndrome.We may say that pseudomonas infections are still an important cause of nosocomial sepsis and mortality in NICUs. Low birth weight and invasive procedures may be predisposing factors for pseudomonas infections. Mortality was associated with underlying disorders.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
