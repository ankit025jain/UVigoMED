{"id":26854,"title":"Stenting of the unprotected left main coronary artery in a nonagenarian presenting with recurrent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.","abstract":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) involving the left main (LM) artery has traditionally been considered an indication for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). With recent advances in the field of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), angioplasty and stenting of the unprotected' LM has been performed in patients at high surgical risk. This is a challenging intervention as a large area of myocardium is at risk during the procedure. Features that make it especially high risk are distal stenosis of this vessel and presence of coronary disease in other territories. Left ventricular assist devices need to be considered in these situations so as to minimize the risk involved. We present a case of a 90-year-old female with myocardial infarction who underwent complex angioplasty involving the distal LM and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, without left ventricular assist device or balloon pump support.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076680","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.813485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.812643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Left coronary artery","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Ventricular assist device","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.769292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.690181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.564349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.285619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.215715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
