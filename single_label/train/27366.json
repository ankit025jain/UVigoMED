{"id":27366,"title":"The MoCA and MMSE as screeners for cognitive impairment in a heart failure population: a study with comprehensive neuropsychological testing.","abstract":"To examine the ability of the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to detect cognitive impairment in persons with heart failure (HF).Although the MMSE and MoCA are commonly used screeners in HF, no research team has validated their performance against neuropsychological testing.Participants were 106 patients with HF (49.1% male, 68.13 Â± 9.82 years) who completed the MoCA, MMSE, and a full neuropsychological battery. Sensitivity and specificity were examined. Discriminant function analyses tested whether the screeners correctly detected cognitive impairment.A MoCA score <25 and MMSE score of <28 yielded optimal sensitivity/specificity (.64/.66 and .70/.66, respectively). The MoCA correctly classified 65% of patients, Wilk's lambda = .91, ?(2)(1) = 9.89, p < .01, and the MMSE correctly classified 68%, Wilk's lambda = .87, ?(2)(1) = 14.26, p < .001.In HF, both the MoCA and MMSE are useful in identifying the majority of patients with and without cognitive impairment. Both tests misclassified approximately one-third of patients, so continued monitoring and evaluation of patients is needed in conjunction with screening.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035250","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.837309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.462149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.303016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Neuropsychological test","weight":0.133498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychological_test"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Discriminant function analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_function_analysis"},{"name":"Lambda","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda"},{"name":"Mini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Unclassified language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclassified_language"},{"name":"Linear discriminant analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis"},{"name":"Option screener","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_screener"},{"name":"Mini-mental state examination","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-mental_state_examination"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Conjunction (grammar)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"}]}
