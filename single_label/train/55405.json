{"id":55405,"title":"An overview of home tonometry and telemetry for intraocular pressure monitoring in humans.","abstract":"To review the existing technology for self-tonometry and evaluate methods for continuous monitoring of IOP currently undergoing development and clinical trials in humans.Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Current glaucoma therapy is focused primarily on lowering intraocular pressures (IOP). Decisions to modify treatment regiments are primarily based on office IOP. Since IOP fluctuates throughout the day, values obtained in the office may be a poor representation of the patient's disease. IOP measurements outside of the physician's office environment would provide better knowledge of the disease state and allow for better-informed medical decision making.We performed a literature search using Medline and IEEE database for studies investigating technologies that have been developed for continuous 24-hour IOP monitoring.There is currently no technology that has been approved for use to allow for continuous monitoring of IOP fluctuations. New experimental technology being developed and currently undergoing clinical trials has demonstrated potential for changing the diagnosis and management of glaucoma.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888380","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.606261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.29415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.286133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.190203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.120576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Inflation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Tonometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonometry"},{"name":"Regiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Representative democracy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy"}]}
