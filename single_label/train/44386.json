{"id":44386,"title":"[Quantitative determination of HBsAg in blood sera and hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA in liver tissue as markers of chronic viral hepatitis B activity].","abstract":"Quantitative evaluation of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) content in liver tissue of patients with moderately active CHBV course compared with inactive HBsAg carriers as well as establishment of a possible link between HBV cccDNA in liver cells and HBsAg level in blood sera in these groups of patients.Patients (n = 34) with CHBV diagnosis were examined for levels ofALT, HBsAg (qualitatively and quantitatively), anti-HBcor IgG, anti-HBe IgG, anti-HCV IgG+IgM, anti-HDV IgG+IgM, HBV DNA in qualitative and quantitative variant. Liver biopsy was carried out in all the patients. HBV DNA was determined in liver tissue by Pollicino T. et al. (2004).Based on HBV DNA PCR, the patients were allocated to a group of inactive HBsAg carriers (n = 16) and CHBV (n = 18) of moderate activity. Viral load in CHBV patients had a mean of 540 +/- 230 IU/ml. ALT level in carriers was comparatively lower than in patients with CHBV. HBsAg level in blood of inactive carriers was significantly lower, 940 +/- 259 IU/ml against 2559 +/- 982 IU/ml in patients with CHBV (p < 0.05). The quantity of cccDNA per 1 cell in inactive HBsAg carriers--0.15 +/- 0.14, and in patients group of CHBV with moderate activity--1.71 +/- 1.32 (p = 0.034).The method of quantitative determination of HBV cccDNA in liver tissue of patients was worked out. Differences in quantitative content of HBsAg in blood sera of inactive carriers and CHBV patients with moderate activity reflect changes in the extent of hepatocyte infection by HBV.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738295","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Circular DNA","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_DNA"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
