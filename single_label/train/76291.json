{"id":76291,"title":"Effects of modified lingguizhugan decoction combined with weekend fasting on metabolic syndrome.","abstract":"To assess the therapeutic effect of weekend fasting and administration of a modified Lingguizhugan decoction on metabolic syndrome (MetS).Twenty-one patients with MetS were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 30-min and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose (PG), fasting serum insulin (FINS), blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were tested. Patients were allowed to drink only water and a Chinese herbal decoction during weekends. All samples were tested again after 12 weeks of treatment.FPG, 30-min PG, 2-h PG, FINIS, LDL-C, systolic BP, diastolic BP, BMI, WC, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with before treatment. Levels of TG, TC, and HDL-C did not change significantly.Weekend fasting improved glucose metabolism, lowered BP, reduced LDL-C levels, BMI, and WC. These data suggest that weekend fasting may be an effective therapy for MetS by protection against coronary atherosclerosis.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102690","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.4317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.272617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.245157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"}]}
