{"id":67305,"title":"Omeprazole-induced acute interstitial nephritis: a possible Th1-Th17-mediated injury?","abstract":"Omeprazole is an important cause of drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). How omeprazole induces injury is unknown.Detailed clinical assessment of 25 biopsy-proven cases of omeprazole-induced AIN showed that all patients presented with impaired renal function, sterile pyuria with varying amounts of proteinuria but no eosinophiluria and no systemic symptoms to suggest a vasculitis. Histological analyses were characteristic of an acute tubulitis with an inflammatory cellular infiltrate. Using modified Banff scheme criteria, mild tubulitis (t1) was present in 56% of cases, a moderate tubulitis (t2) in 24% of cases, and a severe tubulitis in 20% of cases. Most (78%) of cases had mononuclear cell infiltrates, no significant eosinophilic infiltrates were found, and glomeruli were not involved. Immunostaining for CD4, CD8, IL-17A, IL-17F, Foxp3 and T-bet (T cell subsets), CD20 and CD163 defined the cellular infiltrates. The predominant inflammatory cells were CD4+ lymphocytic aggregates (77% of cases), combined with co-staining of CD4 IL and 17A/F in 44-48% of all cases, suggesting a Th17-mediated inflammatory process. T-bet+ cell infiltrates were present to a lesser degree, suggesting additional Th1 involvement. How omeprazole induces this inflammatory response is unclear, but may include direct effects by IL-17 expressing CD4+ cells on renal tubular cells.This large biopsy series of omeprazole-induced AIN demonstrates the features of acute tubulitis, with significant interstitial infiltrates consistent with immunopathological Th17 and Th1 processes.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629073","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.909984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.888243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.825755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.808736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Pyuria","weight":0.732839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyuria"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.704098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.693966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.692933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Omeprazole","weight":0.612264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Interstitial nephritis","weight":0.567055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_nephritis"},{"name":"Eosinophilic","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.450122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.301722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.261989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.224353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.175555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"B symptoms","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_symptoms"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}]}
