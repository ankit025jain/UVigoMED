{"id":33988,"title":"Seizure control in Unverricht-Lundborg disease: a single-centre study.","abstract":"New antiepileptic drug (AED) options for generalised seizure types have been adopted for use as treatment for Unverricht-Lundborg disease. Whether this has led to improved seizure control or functional outcome in ULD patients remains obscure. We retrospectively identified all patients seen at Helsinki University Hospital due to Unverricht-Lundborg disease during 2003-2008 in order to determine which AED treatments had been retained for long-term use. The majority of the patients had severe functional disabilities. In the year preceding the last hospital visit, all patients (n=20) were receiving polytherapy and 14 patients had been free of tonic-clonic seizures. During follow-up, improvement in myoclonia had been recorded for the majority of patients with either add-on piracetam, topiramate, or levetiracetam, but valproate was still in use by all patients. Treatment with lamotrigine had been started and retained less often relative to other AEDs. Add-on AED treatment was often associated with significant adverse effects. Unverricht-Lundborg disease patients may benefit from add-on treatment with levetiracetam or topiramate for seizure control. Treatment of eventual comorbidities with other than AEDs is also discussed.
