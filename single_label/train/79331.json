{"id":79331,"title":"Prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination with carrier-bound Bet v 1 peptides lacking allergen-specific T cell epitopes reduces Bet v 1-specific T cell responses via blocking antibodies in a murine model for birch pollen allergy.","abstract":"Vaccines consisting of allergen-derived peptides lacking IgE reactivity and allergen-specific T cell epitopes bound to allergen-unrelated carrier molecules have been suggested as candidates for allergen-specific immunotherapy.To study whether prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination with carrier-bound peptides from the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 lacking allergen-specific T cell epitopes has influence on Bet v 1-specific T cell responses.Three Bet v 1-derived peptides, devoid of Bet v 1-specific T cell epitopes, were coupled to KLH and adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide to obtain a Bet v 1-specific allergy vaccine. Groups of BALB/c mice were immunized with the peptide vaccine before or after sensitization to Bet v 1. Bet v 1- and peptide-specific antibody responses were analysed by ELISA. T cell and cytokine responses to Bet v 1, KLH, and the peptides were studied in proliferation assays. The effects of peptide-specific and allergen-specific antibodies on T cell responses and allergic lung inflammation were studied using specific antibodies.Prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination with carrier-bound Bet v 1 peptides induced a Bet v 1-specific IgG antibody response without priming/boosting of Bet v 1-specific T cells. Prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination of mice with the peptide vaccine induced Bet v 1-specific antibodies which suppressed Bet v 1-specific T cell responses and allergic lung inflammation.Vaccination with carrier-bound allergen-derived peptides lacking allergen-specific T cell epitopes induces allergen-specific IgG antibodies which suppress allergen-specific T cell responses and allergic lung inflammation.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447086","annotations":[{"name":"Aluminium hydroxide","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.844502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.803683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.758829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.672261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.605739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.562308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.555638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.500849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.421364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin domain","weight":0.403118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Keyhole limpet hemocyanin","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_limpet_hemocyanin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Birch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
