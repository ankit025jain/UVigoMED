{"id":85112,"title":"A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aminophylline for bronchiolitis in infants admitted to intensive care.","abstract":"To determine whether aminophylline reduced the duration of respiratory support in children admitted to intensive care with bronchiolitis.A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial.Paediatric intensive care units in teaching hospitals.Forty-five children with severe bronchiolitis.Patients were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of aminophylline (23) or placebo (22). The primary outcome measure was the number of hours of respiratory support required in the 120 hours after randomisation; respiratory support was defined as either nasal continuous positive airways pressure or mechanical ventilation.The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Respiratory support was required for a median of only 1.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0.4-3.5 days) in the aminophylline group compared with 1.9 days (IQR, 0.3-3.5) days in the placebo group. However, more patients in the placebo group were receiving respiratory support at the time of randomisation and, after adjustment for this, there was no suggestion of a beneficial effect of aminophylline among the small number of patients studied (P=0.54, exact log-rank test stratified by respiratory support at the time of randomisation and censored at the time of death in one child in the aminophylline group).Not enough children were recruited for the study to test the hypothesis that aminophylline reduces the need for respiratory support in severe bronchiolitis. Consequently, the role of aminophylline in the management of severe bronchiolitis remains unknown.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161026","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.850585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.712539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.682305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.471201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.334465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.308774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis"},{"name":"Aminophylline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminophylline"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Censorship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
