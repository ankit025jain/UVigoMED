{"id":24844,"title":"Successful repair of a bicuspid aortic valve with anomalous chordal attachment to the aortic wall.","abstract":"The congenitally bicuspid aortic valve with anomalous chordal attachment of the fused cusp to the aortic wall is a rare and unappreciated cause of aortic insufficiency. We report the case of a 43-year-old male patient who presented with severe aortic insufficiency caused by this anomaly and in whom surgical aortic valve repair was successfully performed. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the successful surgical repair of this rare variant of bicuspid aortic valve.
