{"id":66017,"title":"The ETS family member GABP? modulates androgen receptor signalling and mediates an aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer.","abstract":"In prostate cancer (PC), the androgen receptor (AR) is a key transcription factor at all disease stages, including the advanced stage of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the present study, we show that GABP?, an ETS factor that is up-regulated in PC, is an AR-interacting transcription factor. Expression of GABP? enables PC cell lines to acquire some of the molecular and cellular characteristics of CRPC tissues as well as more aggressive growth phenotypes. GABP? has a transcriptional role that dissects the overlapping cistromes of the two most common ETS gene fusions in PC: overlapping significantly with ETV1 but not with ERG target genes. GABP? bound predominantly to gene promoters, regulated the expression of one-third of AR target genes and modulated sensitivity to AR antagonists in hormone responsive and castrate resistant PC models. This study supports a critical role for GABP? in CRPC and reveals potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
