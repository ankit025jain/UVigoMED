{"id":69593,"title":"Renovascular hypertension: a report of 21 cases.","abstract":"Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is among the most common forms of secondary hypertension. We studied 21 patients (eight male and 13 female) with RVH who were encountered during a period of 16 years. The average age of the patients was 34.75 years. Trans-renal Doppler ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of renovascular stenosis (RAS) as the cause of RVH in 95% of the patients. Computed tomography angiography was performed in ten cases, which confirmed the diagnosis in all these cases. Magnetic resonance angiography was performed in only three patients. Renal scintigraphy was performed in 11 patients, with DTPA in nine patients and with MAG3 in two cases. Arteriography was performed in 15 cases for therapeutic end points. In two patients, we treated the arteries of both kidneys and in 19 cases we treated only one kidney artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in ten cases. Renal arterial stent placement was performed in three cases in which RAS was from an atherosclerosis etiology. Surgical revascularization was performed in four cases. Nephrectomy was necessary in four cases. After interventional treatment, medical treatment using antihypertensive drugs was necessary in 17 of the patients. After treatment, three patients returned to normal kidney function, while worsening of glomerular filtration rate was noted in four patients. Some complications such as a kidney infarct after treatment, a nephrectomy, artery thrombosis, an ischemic stroke and recurrent RAS were also noted.
