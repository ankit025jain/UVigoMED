{"id":23048,"title":"[Evaluation of the association between maternal HCMV viremia and the course of pregnancy and neonatal outcome].","abstract":"Congenital cytomegaly is caused by intrauterine mother-to-fetus HCMV transmission and constitutes the most common vertical infection.The aim of the study was to analyze the viremia level in maternal blood and its influence on the course and duration of pregnancy as well as newborn condition.The material included blood samples collected from 117 pregnant women with serological features of HCMV infection and from 29 neonates hospitalized at DFMMG in Lodz between 1999 and 2009. The presence of HCMV DNA in the maternal and fetal blood was tested using real-time PCR.Prevalence of maternal viremia was observed to increase the risk of viremia in neonates, as compared to children born to mothers with no viremia. However; lack of HCMV DNA in maternal blood does not exclude fetal infection in utero. Newborn condition assessed by Apgar scores was significantly lower in the group of infants born to mothers with serological features of acute cytomegaly (p < 0.05).The assessment of viremia level in maternal blood can be helpful in assessing the risk of intrauterine infection in the fetus as well as in predicting the neonatal outcome of newborn.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505947","annotations":[{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.760342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.622356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.40129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Apgar score","weight":0.215315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Fetal hemoglobin","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
