{"id":43694,"title":"[Cytogenetic status of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract before and after treatment].","abstract":"Aim of this study was to analyze the karyological indicators in exfoliated cells in patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. There was revealed statistically significant (p < 0.01) increase of all parameters in buccal and nasal epithelium in such kind of patients compared to healthy persons. These changes were systemic in nature and reflected the general state of the organism.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772617","annotations":[{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.734501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.641196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0362083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Exfoliation (cosmetology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exfoliation_(cosmetology)"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.018968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Olfactory epithelium","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_epithelium"}]}
