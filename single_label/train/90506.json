{"id":90506,"title":"Mechanisms of injury and CT findings in bowel and mesenteric trauma.","abstract":"Bowel and mesenteric injuries are relatively uncommon but associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early recognition is crucial, and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) now has a central role in the evaluation of patients with a history of trauma. In this review, we describe the MDCT appearances of bowel and mesenteric injuries with reference to findings at surgery. Emphasis is placed on the importance of an understanding of mechanism of injury when interpreting CT findings following abdominal trauma.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606835","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.538739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.190903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Emphasis/Who Wants to Live Forever","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis/Who_Wants_to_Live_Forever"}]}
