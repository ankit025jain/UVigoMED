{"id":44063,"title":"Surgical management of localized soft tissue tumors.","abstract":"Soft tissue tumors are rare and can arise from a variety of soft tissues and viscera in a variety of body sites. Their management requires a thorough understanding of the biology of the different histologies and molecular subtypes as well as the constraints of specific anatomic sites. The surgical approach has undergone significant changes thanks to a better understanding of the natural history of the different histologic subtypes, the importance of site, and the different sensitivity to available drugs. The soft tissue tumor family includes 3 major, distinct categories: desmoid-type fibromatosis, soft tissue sarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. In general, limb-sparing and function-sparing approaches should be used when feasible for tumors located in the extremities and girdles. Resections of adherent structures/viscera, which may be close but not invaded, may be needed in tumors arising in the retroperitoneum/abdomen to minimize microscopic intralesional margins, maximize local tumor control, and possibly improve survival. Margins of resection and the use of adjuvant/neadjuvant radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are contingent on an accurate histologic diagnosis. Treatment planning should include multidisciplinary consultation to determine optimal therapy, taking into consideration tumor histology, site and extent of the disease, its natural history and sensitivity to available treatments, surgical challenges, and-of course-quality of life.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752977","annotations":[{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor","weight":0.831688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.681511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Fibromatosis","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromatosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.617981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.479255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.451825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.445723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
