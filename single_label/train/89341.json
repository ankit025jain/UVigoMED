{"id":89341,"title":"Treatment of hypertrophic burn scars by combination laser-cision and pinhole method using a carbon dioxide laser.","abstract":"Hypertrophic burn scars induce cosmetic and functional complications. Although there are various treatment modalities, an ideal method has not yet been found. Recently, numerous laser treatment modalities have been introduced with encouraging results.To assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with laser-cision and pinhole method using a carbon dioxide (CO2 ) laser.We conducted retrospective chart review of patients with hypertrophic burn scars treated by combination laser-cision and pinhole method from January 2007 to December 2012.Nine patients with hypertrophic burn scars (mean age 31.2 years; range, 13-52 years) were treated with combination therapy over the past 6 years. Subjects were treated with one to three treatment sessions at 1-year intervals by laser-cision and five to eight treatment sessions at 2- to 3-month intervals by pinhole method. Two blinded observers evaluated photographs taken at baseline and 6 months after the final treatment. Compared with baseline, there was a mild to moderate improvement in all the patients (Grades 1-4; mean score: 2.89). The patient satisfaction survey revealed a mean improvement score of 3.11.Combination laser-cision and pinhole method using a CO2 laser may be a new effective treatment option for patients with hypertrophic burn scars.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729387","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.842918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.618673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.498483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"1352","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1352"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Education in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Photorejuvenation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorejuvenation"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
