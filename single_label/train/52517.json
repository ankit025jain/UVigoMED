{"id":52517,"title":"Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 expression in patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma.","abstract":"Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (CYR61) is a key gene in the transforming growth factor-? signalling pathway, which is involved in the development of many tumour types. This study aimed to clarify the status and clinical significance of CYR61 expression in patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma.Tissue from patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma or benign ovarian tumours were investigated retrospectively for CYR61 expression at mRNA and protein levels, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Correlations between immunohistochemical scores and several clinicopathological parameters were investigated.In 50 patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma and 50 patients with benign ovarian tumours, CYR61 expression on mRNA and protein levels was significantly higher in ovarian epithelial carcinoma tissue than in benign ovarian tissue. CYR61 expression was associated with regional lymph node metastases and progression of clinical disease stage. There was no difference in CYR61 expression between patients aged <50 years and ? 50 years.CYR61 expression was significantly upregulated in ovarian carcinoma tissue compared with benign ovarian tumour tissue samples. Protein CYR61 levels were associated with lymph node metastases and Union for International Cancer Control stage. Protein CYR61 may be useful in targeted diagnosis and therapy, for patients with ovarian epithelial carcinoma.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595148","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.620865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.372778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.368227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.227665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.119345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Inducer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inducer"}]}
