{"id":34145,"title":"High plasma homocysteine increases risk of metabolic syndrome in 6 to 8 year old children in rural Nepal.","abstract":"Little attention has been given to the association of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children. We have evaluated the risk of MetS with plasma Hcy in a cohort of 6 to 8 year old rural Nepalese children, born to mothers who had participated in an antenatal micronutrient supplementation trial. We assessed Hcy in plasma from a random selection of n = 1000 children and determined the relationship of elevated Hcy (>12.0 ?mol/L) to MetS (defined as the presence of any three of the following: abdominal adiposity (waist circumference ? 85th percentile of the study population), high plasma glucose (? 85th percentile), high systolic or diastolic blood pressure (? 90th percentile of reference population), triglyceride ? 1.7 mmol/L and high density lipoprotein < 0.9 mmol/L.) and its components. There was an increased risk of low high-density lipoproteins (HDL), [odds ratios (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.08-2.88; p = 0.020], high blood pressure [OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.10-2.46; p = 0.015] and high body mass index (BMI) [OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.33-2.96; p = 0.001] with elevated Hcy. We observed an increased risk of MetS (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06-2.90; p = 0.029) with elevated Hcy in age and gender-adjusted logistic regression models. High plasma Hcy is associated with increased risk of MetS and may have implications for chronic disease later in life.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763111","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.597475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.572535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.51274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.501121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.395975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.225036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.128109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
