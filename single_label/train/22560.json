{"id":22560,"title":"Neonatal tuberculosis and cardiac inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.","abstract":"A 1-month-old neonate was admitted in respiratory distress. Two-dimensional echocardiography and computed tomography scan showed a mass anterior to the left ventricle and right ventricular outflow tract. A biopsy revealed an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. A tuberculin test showed an 18-mm diameter induration. Three of the 6 household contacts were also positive for pulmonary tuberculosis. Antituberculosis medication was started. After 1 year, echocardiography and computed tomography scan showed complete resolution of the mass.
