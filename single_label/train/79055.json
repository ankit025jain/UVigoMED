{"id":79055,"title":"Stagewise treatment of anterior commissure laryngeal web and recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis under endoscope.","abstract":"To evaluate the stagewise treatment of anterior commissure laryngeal web caused by recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis.One patient with anterior commissure laryngeal web caused by recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis underwent laryngomicrosurgery three times. At the same time of using CO2 laser to remove papilloma, we performed vocal cord mucosal flap repair and suture.After 1 year following up, laryngeal papilloma did not recur and the voice quality of the patient significantly improved with no wheezing sound.This method can resolve the problem of recurrence and adhesion in laryngeal papilloma.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499925","annotations":[{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.793781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.776022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.322214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.211916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Anterior commissure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_commissure"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Papillomatosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomatosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Commissure","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissure"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"}]}
