{"id":47200,"title":"Increasing incidence of recent hepatitis D virus infection in HIV-infected patients in an area hyperendemic for hepatitis B virus infection.","abstract":"Superinfection with hepatitis D virus (HDV) may increase the risk for hepatitis flares and chronic hepatic complications in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This retrospective observational study aimed to examine the incidence of and factors associated with recent HDV superinfection among individuals coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV.Anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) was sequentially determined in 375 HIV/HBV-coinfected patients to estimate the HDV incidence between 1992 and 2012. Plasma HDV and HBV loads and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels were determined for the HDV seroconverters. A nested case-control study was conducted to identify the associated factors with HDV seroconversion. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using HDV sequences amplified from HDV seroconverters and HDV-seropositive patients at baseline.During 1762.4 person-years of follow-up [PYFU], 16 patients seroconverted for HDV, with an overall incidence rate of 9.07 per 1000 PYFU, which increased from 0 in 1992-2001, to 3.91 in 2002-2006, to 13.26 per 1000 PYFU in 2007-2012 (P < .05). Recent HDV infection was associated with elevated aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and elevated rapid plasma reagin titers. Of the 12 patients with HDV viremia, 2 were infected with genotype 2 and 10 with genotype 4. HBsAg levels remained elevated despite a significant decline of plasma HBV DNA load with combination antiretroviral therapy that contained lamivudine and/or tenofovir.Our findings show that the incidence of recent HDV infection in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients increased significantly from 1992-2001 to 2007-2011, and was associated with hepatitis flares and syphilis.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599769","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Hepatitis D","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_D"},{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Tenofovir","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Superinfection","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superinfection"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.616916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.578856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.568787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
