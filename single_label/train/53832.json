{"id":53832,"title":"Increased FAT10 expression is related to poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","abstract":"It has been reported that FAT10 plays an important role in cell proliferation. Their activity is increased in malignant cells compared to benign cells. However, the clinical and functional significance of FAT10 expression has not been characterized previously in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The purpose of this study was to assess FAT10 expression and to explore its contribution to PDAC. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to examine FAT10 expression in 38 pairs of fresh frozen PDAC tissues and corresponding noncancerous tissues. Using immunohistochemistry, we performed a retrospective study of the FAT10 expression levels on 134 archival PDAC paraffin-embedded samples. The relationship between FAT10 mRNA expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed by appropriate statistics. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the correlation between FAT10 expression and prognosis of PDAC patients. The relative mRNA expression of FAT10 was significantly higher in PDAC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P<0.001). By immunohistochemistry, the data revealed that high FAT10 expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage (P<0.001), histological differentiation (P=0.004), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.013). Consistent with these results, we found that high expression of FAT10 was significantly correlated with poor survival in PDAC patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, Cox regression analyses showed that FAT10 expression was an independent predictor of overall survival. In conclusion, this study confirmed the overexpression of FAT10 and its association with tumor progression in PDAC. It also provided the first evidence that FAT10 expression in PDAC was an independent prognostic factor of patients, which might be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target of PDAC.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492942","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.649771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.633837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.576475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.492283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.377115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.150053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
