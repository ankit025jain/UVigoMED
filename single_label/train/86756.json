{"id":86756,"title":"Biological effects of (125)i seeds radiation on A549 lung cancer cells: G2/M arrest and enhanced cell death.","abstract":"External beam radiation (EBRT) and (125)I seeds continuous low dose rate radiation (CLDR) were used to treat patients with lung cancer. We herein investigated the biological effects of EBRT and CLDR on lung cancer cells. A549 human lung cancer cell line was thus exposed to different doses of EBRT and CLDR. CLDR was more efficient to inhibit cell growth than EBRT. CLDR induced increased DNA damage as evidenced by long-lasting p-H2AX activity. The enhanced inhibitory effects of CLDR on lung cancer cell growth may be, at least in part, due to the increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio and cyclin B1-mediated G2/M arrest.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745612","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.705167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.690704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.510716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.341204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Cyclin B","weight":0.275845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_B"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Common Locale Data Repository","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Locale_Data_Repository"},{"name":"Cyclin B1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_B1"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"549","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/549"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Iodine-125","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-125"},{"name":"BMW 1 Series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_1_Series"}]}
