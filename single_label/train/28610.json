{"id":28610,"title":"Intimate partner violence victimization: identification and response in primary care.","abstract":"In the United States more than 1 out of 3 women experiences lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization. Short screening instruments such as HITS or the AAS can identify IPV victimization. Nonjudgmental statements that validate an IPV victim's experience should be followed by safety assessment and planning. Intervention includes referral to services, treatment of associated health conditions, mandatory reporting if required, and documentation. Counseling has been shown to reduce IPV victimization. Clinical guidelines recommend IPV screening for all or most women, and providing or referring victims to intervention. The Affordable Care Act will increase coverage of screening and counseling for IPV victims.
