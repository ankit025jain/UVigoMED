{"id":91034,"title":"Digital high-pressure injection injury: the importance of early recognition and treatment.","abstract":"High-pressure injection (HPI) injuries are an uncommon mechanism of trauma. The clinical effects of the HPI injury depend upon a number of variables including the pressures involved, chemical toxicity, quantity of material injected and its temperature. Evidence within the literature has shown that delay in identifying and treating such injuries can lead to devastating consequences. We describe one such case of a HPI injury involving engine oil to a digit. In addition, we review the clinical course, pathophysiology and management of such injuries.
