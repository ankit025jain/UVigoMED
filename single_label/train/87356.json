{"id":87356,"title":"Infrared thermal imaging in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Musculoskeletal injuries occur frequently. Diagnostic tests using ionizing radiation can lead to problems for patients, and infrared thermal imaging could be useful when diagnosing these injuries.A systematic review was performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of infrared thermal imaging in patients with musculoskeletal injuries. A meta-analysis of three studies evaluating stress fractures was performed and found a lack of support for the usefulness of infrared thermal imaging in musculoskeletal injuries diagnosis.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247955","annotations":[{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.733472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.731776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.590848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.439877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.381497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.357338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.233549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
