{"id":33120,"title":"Safety and efficacy of filtered sunlight in treatment of jaundice in African neonates.","abstract":"Evaluate safety and efficacy of filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FS-PT).Term/late preterm infants #14 days old with clinically significant jaundice, assessed by total bilirubin (TB) levels, were recruited from a maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Sunlight was filtered with commercial window-tinting films that remove most UV and significant levels of infrared light and transmit effective levels of therapeutic blue light. After placing infants under an FS-PT canopy, hourly measurements of axillary temperatures, monitoring for sunburn, dehydration, and irradiances of filtered sunlight were performed. Treatment was deemed safe and efficacious if infants were able to stay in FS-PT for $5 hours and rate of rise of TB was ,0.2 mg/dL/h for infants #72 hours of age or TB decreased for infants .72 hours of age.A total of 227 infants received 258 days of FS-PT. No infant developed sunburn or dehydration. On 85 (33%) of 258 treatment days, infants were removed briefly from FS-PT due to minor temperature-related adverse events. No infant met study exit criteria. FS-PT was efficacious in 92% (181/197) of evaluable treatment days. Mean 6 SD TB change was –0.06 6 0.19 mg/dL/h. The mean 6 SD (range) irradiance of FS-PT was 38 6 22 (2–115) mW/cm2/nm, measured by the BiliBlanket Meter II.With appropriate monitoring, filtered sunlight is a novel, practical, and inexpensive method of PT that potentially offers safe and efficacious treatment strategy for management of neonatal jaundice in tropical countries where conventional PT treatment is not available.","date":"2014-07-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864170","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Neonatal jaundice","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_jaundice"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Dehydration","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.684078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.674824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.623998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.504832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.470113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.390004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.381049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Sunlight","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.329937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.299321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.296269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.291115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.187822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.186179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Water filter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_filter"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Canopy (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_(biology)"}]}
