{"id":64974,"title":"[The making of a good male infertility microsurgeon: learning experience at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University].","abstract":"Male infertility microsurgery represents the fastest growing sub-specialty in urology and clinical andrology over the past two decades. The importance of microsurgery for male infertility has risen as a part of the urologist's armamentarium in the medical and surgical management of male infertility. Despite the advances in male infertility microsurgery in China, the lack of standardized and well-organized training programs for male infertility microsurgery remains a serious problem affecting its development. In this article, Zhao and Peng have shared their experience with the learning curve of male infertility microsurgery at the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and Microsurgery, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, which centers on how to pay attention to the details and basic principles of microsurgery. Male infertility microsurgery is physically, technically and mentally challenging, and must be first learned in the laboratory. Clinical success depends heavily upon appropriate training in a microsurgical laboratory. Good training can significantly reduce operation time and surgical errors as well as improve the quality of outcomes.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095615","annotations":[{"name":"Cornell University","weight":0.839338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.703229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University","weight":0.62485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weill_Cornell_Medical_College_of_Cornell_University"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.616385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.580204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Andrology","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.350695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.217893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Reproductive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_medicine"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Kurt Weill","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Zhao (state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_(state)"},{"name":"Peng (mythology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology)"},{"name":"Medical college","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_college"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Learning curve","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve"}]}
