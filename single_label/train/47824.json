{"id":47824,"title":"Robuvit® (French oak wood extract) in the management of functional, temporary hepatic damage. A registry, pilot study.","abstract":"The aim of this registry study was to evaluate the evolution of moderate functional hepatic failure (MTHF) using a proprietary new oak wood supplement (Robuvit®) extracted from Quercus Robur. Recent studies have indicated the protective effect of oak wood extracts on liver injury. Quercus wood extracts have shown hepatoprotective effect on initial induced liver-injury.This registry included a total of 75 patients with MTHF characterized by: decreased albumin levels; increased total bilirubin, altered hepatic functions enzymes, increased oxidative stress, negative viral hepatitis markers.The two groups (best management in comparison with best management+ Robuvit®) were comparable: 32 Robuvit® patients and 29 comparable controls) completed the 12-week registry. At inclusion, the blood parameter values in the two groups were comparable. At the end of the supplementation period, the increase in albumin levels was significantly (P<0.05 at 12 weeks) faster and higher in the Robuvit® group. The decrease in ALT-SGPT and AST-ASAT was significant in the supplement group (P<0.05 at 4 and 12 weeks); the tests were normalized at 4 and 12 weeks. Controls remained out of the normal range for more than 12 weeks. Alkaline phosphatase was normalized at 4 and 12 weeks in Robuvit® patients; they were decreased, but not normalized in controls at 4 weeks (Robuvit® group's values were significantly better; P<0.05). Values were normalized in controls (significantly higher in comparison with Robuvit®; P<0.05) at 12 weeks. Total bilirubin was normalized in Robuvit® subjects at 4 and 12 weeks. Results were significantly better in comparison with controls (P<0.05). Direct bilirubin values increased more in the Robuvit® group at 4 and 12 weeks (P<0.05). Gamma GT values were normalized at 4 and 12 weeks in the Robuvit® group. There was a less important decrease in controls (P<0.05) without normalization at 12 weeks. Plasma free radicals increased at inclusion showed a significant decrease in Robuvit® subject (at 4 and 12 weeks) with normalization at 12 weeks. Persisting, elevated values in controls were observed even at 12 weeks (P<0.05). ESR and CRP decreased in both groups with a more important decrease in the Robuvit® group (P<0.05). Hepatitis markers were negative when repeated at 4 and 12 weeks.Data from this pilot, supplement registry study indicate a significant protective activity of Robuvit®, associated with a very good safety profile, in patients with temporary hepatic failure. The activity of Robuvit® seems to be mediated by its anti-inflammatory activity.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572451","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.838133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.829999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.794133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.633552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.529832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.26201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Wood","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood"},{"name":"France","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Oak","weight":0.0777788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Oak (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(wine)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
