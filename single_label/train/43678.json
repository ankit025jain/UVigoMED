{"id":43678,"title":"Evaluation of leptin and insulin resistance in patients with cholelithiasis.","abstract":"The association between insulin resistance, lipoproteins and leptin was evaluated in cholelithiasis. The study group included 55 women (68.8%) and 25 men (31.3%) with a mean age and SD of 50.56 +/- 14.28 yrs. The control group included 25 women (62.5%) and 15 men (37.5%) with a mean age of 50.93 +/- 11.73 yrs. Serum leptin levels were measured by the enzyme immunoassay method. HOMA-IR was determined by using fasting glucose and insulin levels. Insulin, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HOMA-IR (p < 0.01) and leptin (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the cholelithiasis group, compared to the controls. In patients with a HOMA-IR >2.2, age, body mass index (BMI), glucose, insulin, triglycerides (TG), TC and leptin levels were higher than in patients with a HOMA-IR < 2.2. In patients with glucose levels >100 mg/dl, mean BMI, HOMA-IR, insulin, TG, TC and leptin levels were significantly higher than in patients with glucose levels <100 mg/dl. In patients with TG levels >150 mg/dl, mean age, BMI, glucose, insulin, TC, leptin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher than in patients with TG levels < 150 mg/dl. In patients with BMI > 25 kg/m2, mean age, glucose, insulin, TG, TC, leptin, HOMA-IR were significantly higher than in patients with BMI < 25. In cholelithiasis group, there was a positive correlation between leptin and age, BMI, glucose, insulin, TG, TC, LDL-C or HOMA-IR. In conclusion, we found a positive association between increased leptin levels and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in cholelithiasis. Cholelithiasis subjects with insulin resistance showed higher cardiometabolic risk factors than those without it.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772944","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.915784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.874738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.56748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.421615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
