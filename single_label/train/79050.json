{"id":79050,"title":"[Is smoking cigarettes affects the nasal patency in the light of the project ECAP (Epidemiology of Allergic Diseases in Poland) in the Polish population in 2006-2009?].","abstract":"The purpose of the study was an attempt to estimate the impact of tobacco smoke on the nasal patency in the light of the ECAP study. The subjects in the study was a group of 4674 people, including 1291 children aged 6-7 years (643 girls and 648 boys), 1293 children aged 13-14 years (625 girls, 668 boys) and 2090 adults (1284 women, 806 men). The research method used in the study was the measurement of the peak nasal flow using a peak flow meter with a dedicated mask used in rhinomanometry tests, with a measurement scale of 20-350 l/min. The study was carried out in 2006-2007, in the following cities Katowice, Wroc?aw, Krak√≥w, Lublin, Warszawa, Bydgoszcz, Gda?sk, and in the rural areas of the former Zamojskie province.For the purposes of the study, the average PNIF levels were calculated for the subjects in terms of the following criteria: age: In the case of the children aged 6-7 years (n=1291), the average PNIF level was 52.4 I/min. For the children aged 13-14 years (n=1291), the average level was 94.7 l/min., and in the case of adults (n=2090)--approx. 108.0 l/min. gender: The nasal patency level was definitely higher in the male subjects than in the female subjects in all the age groups. passive smokers: 105.3 l/min (n=1202) and active smokers: 119.1 l/min (n=885).The possible effect of tobacco smoke on nasal patency in the population included in the study is not a direct risk factor in breathing disorders.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
