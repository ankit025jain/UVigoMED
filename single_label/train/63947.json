{"id":63947,"title":"Cardiovascular risk in patients with hemophilia.","abstract":"Patients with hemophilia, who have a lifelong hypocoagulability, seem to have a lower cardiovascular mortality than the general population. Nevertheless, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with hemophilia is as prevalent as in the general population, and hypertension is even more common. Furthermore, hemophiliacs have the same degree of atherosclerosis as the general population. The reduced cardiovascular mortality may be explained by reduced thrombus formation resulting from hypocoagulability. On the other hand, hemophilia, which is associated with reduced thrombin generation, may also increase atherosclerotic plaque stability, as has been shown in mice. Because treatment of these events is extremely challenging in patients with increased bleeding tendency, detection and aggressive treatment of risk factors is mandatory.
