{"id":54958,"title":"Effects of a lutein supplement on the plasma lutein concentration and macular pigment in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of lutein supplementation on plasma lutein concentrations and the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) in central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).In this double-masked placebo-controlled study, 20 patients received lutein 20 mg/d and 19 received placebo. The plasma lutein concentration and MPOD using autofluorescence spectrometry (density unit, DU) were measured at baseline and 1 and 4 months.The mean plasma lutein concentrations and MPOD values in the lutein and control groups, respectively, were 91.5 and 78.2 ng/mL and 0.444 and 0.437 DU at baseline; 204.9 and 79.3 ng/mL and 0.460 and 0.442 DU at 1 month; and 228.0 and 78.4 ng/mL and 0.441 and 0.421 DU at 4 months. The plasma concentration in the lutein group was significantly higher than in controls at 1 and 4 months (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons); however, the MPOD values did not differ significantly between groups at 1 (P = 0.479) or 4 months (P = 0.883). In patients with a plasma lutein concentration below the mean level in 20 age-matched healthy subjects (mean 105.3 ng/mL; n = 13 in lutein group, n = 15 in control group), the control MPOD values significantly (P = 0.0430) decreased at 4 months (mean baseline, 0.437 DU; 4 months, 0.404 DU). The MPOD in the lutein group remained at the baseline level (mean baseline, 0.426 DU; 4 months, 0.438 DU) (P = 0.6542).The MPOD did not increase in patients with CSC with short-term lutein supplementation; however, among patients with low plasma lutein, supplemental lutein prevented a decline in MPOD that was observed in control subjects (www.umin.ac.jp/ctr number, UMIN000005849).","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074771","annotations":[{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.462332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.330056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.276781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.26279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.215637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.184721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Lutein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein"},{"name":"Autofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofluorescence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"883","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/883"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 426","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_426"},{"name":"Moru language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moru_language"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"KBFP-FM","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBFP-FM"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
