{"id":72303,"title":"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves outcome of recurrent advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Locally recurrent rate of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) still remains high and the treatment is controversial.We retrospectively analyzed ninety-three patients with recurrent advanced oral cancer from 2009 to 2013. Sixty-four patients are in the docetaxel with cisplatin and 5'-fluorouracil (TPF) group and the remaining twenty-nine patients are in the cisplatin and 5'-fluorouracil (PF) group.The overall response rate was better in the TPF group (p=0.005) than the PF group. Patients who received induction chemotherapy, TPF, followed by surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) had better overall survival (OS) (p=0.012) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.038), while patients with prior intra-arterial-infusion-chemotherapy had an adverse impact on OS (p=0.039).We showed that induction chemotherapy with TPF, followed by surgery and consolidation CRT, is the ideal choice for recurrent advanced HNSCC with improving response rates and survival. However, prior intra-arterial-infusion-chemotherapy showed an adverse impact.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982400","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.523759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.47099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.145792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Transaction Processing Facility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_Processing_Facility"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
