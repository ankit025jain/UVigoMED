{"id":32723,"title":"Stridor in asphyxiated neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.","abstract":"Therapeutic hypothermia is an established standard of care in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Application of therapeutic hypothermia in the clinical setting may reveal a wider spectrum of adverse events than previously reported. We report 5 cases of transient respiratory stridor in 51 infants, occurring at different time points in the cooling process, which appeared to be unrelated to the intubation procedure. Therapeutic hypothermia was associated with transient stridor in this case series. Formal laryngoscopy is required to determine the underlying pathologic etiology.
