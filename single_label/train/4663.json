{"id":4663,"title":"Mini-implant-borne Pendulum B appliance for maxillary molar distalisation: design and clinical procedure.","abstract":"A treatment objective of upper molar distalisation may often be required during the correction of a malocclusion. Distalisation is not only indicated for the management of Class II patients, but also for Class III surgery patients who require decompensation in the upper arch if upper incisor retrusion is needed. Unfortunately, most conventional intra-oral devices for non-compliance maxillary molar distalisation experience anchorage loss. A Pendulum type of appliance and a mini-implant-borne distalisation mechanism have been designed which can be inserted at chair-side, without a prior laboratory procedure and immediately after mini-implant placement. For re-activation purposes, a distal screw may be added to the Pendulum B appliance.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549527","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.714331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.201596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.126815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0347132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0344458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pendulum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Anchorage, Alaska","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska"}]}
