{"id":10719,"title":"Atomoxetine-induced increases in monoamine release in the prefrontal cortex are similar in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats.","abstract":"Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) are used as a model for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), since SHRs are hyperactive and show defective sustained attention in behavioral tasks. The psychostimulants amphetamine and methylphenidate and the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine are used as ADHD medications. The effects of high K(+) stimulation or psychostimulants on brain norepinephrine or dopamine release in SHRs have been previously studied both in vitro and in vivo, but the effects of atomoxetine on these neurotransmitters have not. The present study examined the effects of administration of atomoxetine on extracellular norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex of juvenile SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Baseline levels of prefrontal norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin were similar in SHRs and WKY rats. Systemic administration of atomoxetine (3 mg/kg) induced similar increases in prefrontal norepinephrine and dopamine, but not serotonin, levels in both strains. Furthermore, there was no difference in high K(+)-induced increases in extracellular norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex between SHRs and WKY rats. These findings indicate that monoamine systems in the prefrontal cortex are similar between SHRs and WKY rats.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634253","annotations":[{"name":"Atomoxetine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Methylphenidate","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Prefrontal cortex","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.776043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Monoamine neurotransmitter","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.534725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.487722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
