{"id":47592,"title":"Esophagectomy outcomes at a mid-volume cancer center utilizing prospective multidisciplinary care and a 2-surgeon team approach.","abstract":"Esophagectomy is associated with high morbidity and mortality, leading to calls for restricted performance at high-volume centers.Patients with esophageal cancer were evaluated prospectively in a multidisciplinary tumor board from January 2012 - December 2012. A 2-surgeon team was utilized and detailed outcomes were assessed prospectively.Thirty-one patients underwent esophagectomy, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic transhiatal (65%) approach, and 11 patients underwent laparoscopically assisted Ivor-Lewis (35%) approach. Eighty-one percent of the patients were male, with a median age of 64 years (range: 35 to 83 years) and 73% of the patients had adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation was performed in 79% of the patients. R0 resection was achieved in 29 (94%) patients, median nodes identified were 15. Major complications (grade III to V) occurred in 13 (42%) patients and did not correlate with surgical techniques, anastomotic leak occurred in 5 (16%) patients, and significant pulmonary complications occurred in 11 (35%) patients. The length of stay at the hospital was 10 days, readmission rate 23%, and 30-day mortality rate 6%.High-quality esophagectomy can be performed safely at a mid-volume cancer center. Our outcomes question the reliance on volume alone as an indicator of cancer surgical quality.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581762","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.61431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.59582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.445423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.302663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
