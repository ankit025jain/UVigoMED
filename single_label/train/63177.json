{"id":63177,"title":"Tc1 clonal T cell expansion during chronic graft-versus-host disease-associated hypereosinophilia.","abstract":"Although hypereosinophilia (HE) associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has long been recognized, biological data on this phenomenon are scarce. Here we compare patients with chronic GVHD with HE together with a clonal T cell expansion and control patients with acute or chronic GVHD but without HE. These clonal expansions share a CD8(+) TC1 phenotype rather than a CD4(+) Th2 profile. In contrast to the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, these allogeneic CD8(+) clones do not recognize the epitopes of herpesviruses. Furthermore, these TC1 clones do not produce IL-17 as described in the DRESS syndrome.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468638","annotations":[{"name":"T cell","weight":0.813258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.583857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.497848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.494927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.456468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.409686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.341032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.245077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"DRESS syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRESS_syndrome"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Calendar-based contraceptive methods","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar-based_contraceptive_methods"},{"name":"Expansion pack","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack"},{"name":"BBC Television Centre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Television_Centre"},{"name":"B symptoms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_symptoms"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Biological data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_data"}]}
