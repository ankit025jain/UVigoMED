{"id":35969,"title":"[About military medical examination of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular reciprocating tachycardia].","abstract":"140 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular reciprocating tachycardia were treated with the help of radio frequency ablation; results of treatment were analyzed. First group consisted of 76 patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, second group--64 patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia accompanied with WPW syndrome and preexcitation syndrome. In first group the operation ended up with success in 94.7%, in the second group--90.6%, after the second operation--100% and 96.1% relatively. Different complications in patients from the first group occured in 3.9%, in the second group--in 6.3%. Taking into account high effectivennes and safety of radio frequency ablation, it is recommended to reconsider principals of categorisation of fitness for service among conscripts and servicemen doing call-up and under the contract military service and also citizens, entering military educational institutions.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611308","annotations":[{"name":"Military","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.626523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.452287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Radio","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.206273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Citizenship","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"},{"name":"Military medicine","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_medicine"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Military service","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reentrant (computing)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrant_(computing)"},{"name":"AV nodal reentrant tachycardia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_nodal_reentrant_tachycardia"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Reciprocating engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocating_engine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Supraventricular tachycardia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Second Ostend Raid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ostend_Raid"}]}
