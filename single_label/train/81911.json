{"id":81911,"title":"Physical properties of root cementum: part 24. Root resorption of the first premolars after 4 weeks of occlusal trauma.","abstract":"In orthodontics, adding restorative materials on occlusal or lingual surfaces is a common method to create a mini-biteplane to increase patients' vertical dimension temporarily to facilitate several treatment procedures. However, this method transmits excessive occlusal forces through the periodontal ligament and causes trauma. In this prospective randomized clinical trial, we measured and compared quantitatively the volumes of root resorption after 4 weeks of occlusal trauma.Forty-eight maxillary and mandibular first premolars of 12 patients (6 girls, 6 boys) comprised the sample for this study. One side of each patient was randomly selected as the control. On the contralateral side, a light-cured glass ionomer cement (Transbond Plus Light Cure Band Adhesive; 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) was bonded onto the occlusal surface of the mandibular first premolar so that the cement was in contact with the maxillary first premolar. After 4 weeks, both first premolars were extracted. Each sample was imaged using a microcomputed tomography system (1172; SkyScan, Aartselaar, Belgium) and analyzed with specially designed software for volumetric measurements of resorption craters. Furthermore, pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale for 7 days.There were significant differences in the amounts of root resorption between the control and the experimentally traumatized teeth. No significant difference among the buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal surfaces was found in either jaw. Furthermore, no significant difference existed in the amount of root resorption among the cervical, middle, and apical thirds of both jaws. There was no correlation between age, sex, volume of the root resorption craters, and pain.Restorative buildups, used to increase the vertical dimension by 2 mm for 4 weeks, caused root resorption along the sides of the teeth during the active bite-increase period.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic
