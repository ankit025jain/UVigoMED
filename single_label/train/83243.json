{"id":83243,"title":"A calcium prerinse required to form calcium fluoride in plaque from a sodium fluoride rinse.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to determine whether a calcium (Ca) prerinse used before a 228 Âµg/g (ppm) fluoride (F) rinse would induce the formation of 'calcium fluoride-like' (CaF2-like) deposits in human dental plaque. Sixty minutes after the use of the Ca prerinse/F rinse, plaque samples were collected from 10 volunteers, homogenized, and split into 2 aliquots. The plaque mass from one aliquot was then extracted with a 'plaque-like' solution that extracted all the CaF2-like deposits. The total F in both aliquots was then determined and compared. The results demonstrated that, as in previous studies, the Ca prerinse induced large increases in plaque fluid and total plaque F. However, unlike previous results without the Ca prerinse, 30% of the plaque F deposits were CaF2 or CaF2-like. Given that maintaining an elevated F concentration in the vicinity of a developing lesion may play an important role in the cariostatic effect of this ion, and the potential advantages of CaF2-like deposits as an F source, these results suggest that a Ca prerinse may increase the cariostatic effect of topical agents.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401761","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.792581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.621983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.488317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.43264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Calcium fluoride","weight":0.0822457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_fluoride"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Deposition (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(geology)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Homogenization (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(chemistry)"},{"name":".gg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.gg"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
