{"id":90177,"title":"Traumatic intraneural bone fracture fragment.","abstract":"Intraneural bone was identified on pathologic examination of a neuroma-in-continuity resected for repair of the suprascapular nerve 4 months after a brachial plexus injury. The acute onset of the neurologic deficit, the location of the neuroma within the scapular notch, and the proximity of the neural pathology to a comminuted scapula fracture suggest traumatic penetration of the nerve by a bone fragment. To the authors' knowledge, the observation of bone within a neuroma has not been previously reported.
