{"id":79721,"title":"The molecular arms race between African trypanosomes and humans.","abstract":"Humans can survive bloodstream infection by African trypanosomes, owing to the activity of serum complexes that have efficient trypanosome-killing ability. The two trypanosome subspecies that are responsible for human sleeping sickness--Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense--can evade this defence mechanism by expressing distinct resistance proteins. In turn, sequence variation in the gene that encodes the trypanosome-killing component in human serum has enabled populations in western Africa to restore resistance to T. b. rhodesiense, at the expense of the high probability of developing kidney sclerosis. These findings highlight the importance of resistance to trypanosomes in human evolution.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975321","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.748965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Subspecies","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Human evolution","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.689941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.587473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.482254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Trypanosoma brucei","weight":0.4149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_brucei"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.239264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Trypanosomatid","weight":0.120727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosomatid"},{"name":"West Africa","weight":0.113333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa"},{"name":"Arms race","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Defence mechanism","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"National security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
