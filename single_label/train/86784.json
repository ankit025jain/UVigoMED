{"id":86784,"title":"[Bronchial hamartoma in subsegmental bronchus; report of a case].","abstract":"We report a rare surgical case of a bronchial hamartoma in subsegmental bronchus. A 70-year-old man was incidentally pointed out an abnormal chest shadow without any complaints. Chest computed tomography revealed a round nodule with diameter of 15 mm in the right upper lobe. The bronchoscopic examination revealed complete obstruction of right B2a by the tumor. Right S2 segmentectomy was done to make a definite diagnosis and to prevent possible obstructive pneumonia. Histopathological examination revealed that the tumor was a benign cartilage bronchial hamartoma.
