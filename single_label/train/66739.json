{"id":66739,"title":"Urine proteomics for acute kidney injury prognosis: another player and the long road ahead.","abstract":"Urine represents a mine for proteomic markers of renal diseases, but its analysis is hindered by unresolved technical issues. Aregger et al. used an unbiased proteomics approach to analyze urine of critically ill patients. They discovered insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7) and linked it to acute kidney injury (AKI) outcome. Future efforts should address the biology of IGFBP-7 and related proteins to determine their role in AKI.
