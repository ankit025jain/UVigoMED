{"id":50727,"title":"Advancing our understanding of the glucose system via modeling: a perspective.","abstract":"The glucose story begins with Claude Bernard's discovery of glycogen and milieu interieur, continued with Banting's and Best's discovery of insulin and with Rudolf Schoenheimer's paradigm of dynamic body constituents. Tracers and compartmental models allowed moving to the first quantitative pictures of the system and stimulated important developments in terms of modeling methodology. Three classes of multiscale models, models to measure, models to simulate, and models to control the glucose system, are reviewed in their historical development with an eye to the future.
