{"id":10656,"title":"An anoxia-starvation model for ischemia/reperfusion in C. elegans.","abstract":"Protocols for anoxia/starvation in the genetic model organism C. elegans simulate ischemia/reperfusion. Worms are separated from bacterial food and placed under anoxia for 20 hr (simulated ischemia), and subsequently moved to a normal atmosphere with food (simulated reperfusion). This experimental paradigm results in increased death and neuronal damage, and techniques are presented to assess organism viability, alterations to the morphology of touch neuron processes, as well as touch sensitivity, which represents the behavioral output of neuronal function. Finally, a method for constructing hypoxic incubators using common kitchen storage containers is described. The addition of a mass flow control unit allows for alterations to be made to the gas mixture in the custom incubators, and a circulating water bath allows for both temperature control and makes it easy to identify leaks. This method provides a low cost alternative to commercially available units.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637332","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.868479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.72372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Atmosphere","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Caenorhabditis elegans","weight":0.670581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.652863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.622519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.357516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.345789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Kitchen","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.025043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Intermodal container","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Breathing gas","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0116672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"}]}
