{"id":45473,"title":"Respiratory events in infants presenting with apparent life threatening events: is there an explanation from esophageal motility?","abstract":"To test the hypothesis that proximal aerodigestive clearance mechanisms mediated by pharyngoesophageal motility during spontaneous respiratory events (SREs) are distinct in infants with apparent life threatening events (ALTEs).Twenty infants (10 with proven ALTE, 10 healthy controls) had pharyngoesophageal manometry to investigate motility changes concurrent with respiratory events detected by respiratory inductance plethysmography and nasal thermistor methods. We measured changes in resting upper esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter pressures, esophageal peristalsis characteristics, and gastroesophageal reflux. Statistical analysis included mixed models; data presented as meanÂ±SD, median (range), or percentage.Infants with ALTE (vs controls) had: (1) delays in restoring aerodigestive normalcy as indicated by more frequent (P=.03) and prolonged SREs (P<.01); (2) a lower magnitude of protective upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflexes (P=.01); (3) swallowing as the most frequent esophageal event associated with SREs (84%), with primary peristalsis as the most prominent aerodigestive clearance mechanism (64% vs 38%, P<.01); (4) a higher proportion of failed esophageal propagation (10% vs 0%, P=.02); and (5) more frequent mixed apneic mechanisms (P<.01) and more gasping breaths (P=.04).In infants with ALTE, prolonged SREs are associated with ineffective esophageal motility characterized by frequent primary peristalsis and significant propagation failure, thus suggestive of dysfunctional regulation of swallow-respiratory junction interactions. Hence, treatment should not target gastroesophageal reflux, but rather the proximal aerodigestive tract.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681180","annotations":[{"name":"Peristalsis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.730769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.654783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.648652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.647712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.603596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Upper esophageal sphincter","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_esophageal_sphincter"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Thermistor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor"},{"name":"Inductance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance"},{"name":"Association of Language Testers in Europe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Language_Testers_in_Europe"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Respiratory inductance plethysmography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_inductance_plethysmography"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Normalcy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Multilevel model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Plethysmograph","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plethysmograph"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
