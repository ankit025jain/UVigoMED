{"id":86337,"title":"Normobaric hypoxia and symptoms of acute mountain sickness: Elevated brain volume and intracranial hypertension.","abstract":"The study was undertaken to determine whether normobaric hypoxia causes elevated brain volume and intracranial pressure in individuals with symptoms consistent with acute mountain sickness (AMS).Thirteen males age?=?(26 (sd 6)) years were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (12% O2 ) and normoxia (21% O2 ). After 2 and 10 hours, AMS symptoms were assessed alongside ventricular and venous vessel volumes, cerebral blood flow, regional brain volumes, and intracranial pressure, using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.In normoxia, neither lateral ventricular volume (R(2) ?=?0.07, p?=?0.40) nor predominance of unilateral transverse venous sinus drainage (R(2) ?=?0.07, p?=?0.45) was related to AMS symptoms. Furthermore, despite an increase in cerebral blood flow after 2 hours of hypoxia (hypoxia vs normoxia: ?148ml/min(-1) , 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?58 to 238), by 10 hours, when AMS symptoms had developed, cerebral blood flow was normal (?-51ml/min(-1) , 95% CI?=?-141 to 39). Conversely, at 10 hours brain volume was increased (?59ml, 95% CI?=?8 to 110), predominantly due to an increase in gray matter volume (?73ml, 95% CI?=?25 to 120). Therefore, cerebral spinal fluid volume was decreased (?-40ml, 95% CI?=?-67 to -14). The intracranial pressure response to hypoxia varied between individuals, and as hypothesized, the most AMS-symptomatic participants had the largest increases in intracranial pressure (AMS present, ?7mmHg, 95% CI?=?-2.5 to 17.3; AMS not present, ?-1mmHg, 95% CI?=?-3.3 to 0.5). Consequently, there was a significant relationship between the change in intracranial pressure and AMS symptom severity (R(2) ?=?0.71, p?=?0.002).The data provide the strongest evidence to date to support the hypothesis that the \"random\" nature of AMS symptomology is explained by a variable intracranial pressure response to hypoxia.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract
