{"id":51731,"title":"Predictive value of high-sensitivity troponin-I for future adverse cardiovascular outcome in stable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I(hs-TnI) and T levels(hs-TnT) are sensitive biomarkers of cardiomyocyte turnover or necrosis. Prior studies of the predictive role of hs-TnT in type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) patients have yielded conflicting results. This study aimed to determine whether hs-TnI, which is detectable in a higher proportion of normal subjects than hsTnT, is associated with a major adverse cardiovascular event(MACE) in T2DM patients.We compared hs-TnI level in stored serum samples from 276 consecutive patients (mean age 65?Â±?10 years; 57% male) with T2DM with that of 115 age-and sex-matched controls. All T2DM patients were prospectively followed up for at least 4 years for incidence of MACE including heart failure(HF), myocardial infarction(MI) and cardiovascular mortality. At baseline, 274(99%) patients with T2DM had detectable hs-TnI, and 57(21%) had elevated hs-TnI (male: 8.5 ng/L, female: 7.6 ng/L, above the 99th percentile in healthy controls). A total of 43 MACE occurred: HF(n?=?18), MI(n?=?11) and cardiovascular mortality(n?=?14). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that an elevated hs-TnI was associated with MACE, HF, MI and cardiovascular mortality. Although multivariate analysis revealed that an elevated hs-TnI independently predicted MACE, it had limited sensitivity(62.7%) and positive predictive value(38.5%). Contrary to this, a normal hs-TnI level had an excellent negative predictive value(92.2%) for future MACE in patients with T2DM.The present study demonstrates that elevated hs-TnI in patients with T2DM is associated with increased MACE, HF, MI and cardiovascular mortality. Importantly, a normal hs-TnI level has an excellent negative predictive value for future adverse cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661773","annotations":[{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.778698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.618664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.422552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.125193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"99th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"MOS Technology 6510","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510"}]}
