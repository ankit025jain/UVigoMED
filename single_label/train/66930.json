{"id":66930,"title":"History of distal gastrectomy prevents metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to metabolic syndrome has recently become a social problem in Japan. In this report, the associations between the history of distal gastrectomy (DG) and the incidence of metabolic syndrome or CKD were evaluated.Arteriosclerosis-related factors were compared among patients with a history of DG who were <70 years old (n=41) and controls selected at random (n=410) after matching for age and sex.The patients with a history of DG were less obese than controls and had lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol serum levels. Furthermore, they had an excellent estimated glomerular filtration rate, which was used as an index of CKD.These findings suggest that a history of DG prevents metabolic syndrome and reduces the risk of CKD.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661755","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.561383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.111518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Social issues","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issues"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Sociology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology"}]}
