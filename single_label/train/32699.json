{"id":32699,"title":"A prospective observational multicenter study of balloon angioplasty for the treatment of native and recurrent coarctation of the aorta.","abstract":"Balloon angioplasty (BA) is an important treatment option for coarctation of the aorta. The congenital cardiovascular interventional study consortium (CCISC) represents a multi-institutional and multi-national effort to prospectively investigate congenital cardiac interventions. A prospective observational analysis of the efficacy and safety of balloon aortic angioplasty was conducted.Data were collected prospectively from 36 CCISC sites from 2004 to 2012. One hundred and thirty patients underwent BA for native (n = 76) and recurrent (n = 54) coarctation. Acute, short-term, and intermediate outcomes are described for BA performed in the setting of native and recurrent coarctation of the aorta. Outcome measures included residual upper to lower extremity blood pressure gradient (ULG), use of antihypertensive medications, aortic wall injury, reobstruction, and need for reintervention.There was no procedural mortality. Acutely in native and recurrent coarctation, BA achieved an ULG less than 15 mm Hg in 73-80% and to less than 10 mm Hg in 54-68% of patients, respectively. At intermediate follow-up, ULG further improved, particularly for those who underwent initial reintervention for recurrent coarctation. No significant differences in aortic wall complications were seen and intervention free survival was similar for both groups. Following angioplasty, there was no significant difference in aortic wall complications; however follow up integrated imaging decreased over time.BA is a safe and effective treatment for coarctation of the aorta acutely and at intermediate term. Although aortic injury occurred in patients with both native and recurrent coarctation, at intermediate follow-up, aneurysm was noted more often in those with initial intervention for native coarctation.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917074","annotations":[{"name":"Coarctation of the aorta","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_the_aorta"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.655648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.651453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.0968186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"}]}
