{"id":62037,"title":"Epidemiological and etiological characteristics of fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome in Henan Province, China, 2011-2012.","abstract":"The Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia Syndrome (FTLS) is caused by a bunyavirus known as the FTLS virus (FTLSV), which was recently discovered in China. We examined the epidemiological and etiological features of 637 laboratory-confirmed cases of FTLS with onset from January 2011 to December 2012 in Henan Province, China. The highest incidence of FTLS occurred between May and August: 76.5% of all laboratory-confirmed cases occurred during those four months. Of the laboratory-confirmed cases, 60.9% were in the 46-69 years old age groups; 96.1% (612/637) occurred in farmers; 98.1% (625/637) were reported from Xinyang Prefecture. During the same time period, 2047 cases were reported in China. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of FTLSV strains identified during 2011-2012 in Henan Province were ? 96% identical. This findings provides insight for developing public-health interventions for the control and prevention of FTLS in epidemic area.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633131","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.784929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.681074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"China","weight":0.652292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Henan","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Bunyaviridae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyaviridae"},{"name":"Xinyang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinyang"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2047","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2047"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"}]}
