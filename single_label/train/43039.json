{"id":43039,"title":"Etrolizumab as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis: a randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial.","abstract":"Etrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds the ?7 subunit of the heterodimeric integrins ?4?7 and ?E?7. We aimed to assess etrolizumab in patients with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis.Between Sept 2, 2011, and July 11, 2012, 124 patients were randomly assigned, of whom five had a endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 and were excluded from the mITT population, leaving 39 patients in the etrolizumab 100 mg group, 39 in the etrolizumab 300 mg plus LD group, and 41 in the placebo group for the primary analyses. No patients in the placebo group had clinical remission at week 10, compared with eight (21% [95% CI 7-36]) patients in the etrolizumab 100 mg group (p=0·0040) and four (10% [0·2-24]) patients in the 300 mg plus LD group (p=0·048). Adverse events occurred in 25 (61%) of 41 patients in the etrolizumab 100 mg group (five [12%] of which were regarded as serious), 19 (48%) of 40 patients in the etrolizumab 300 mg plus LD group (two [5%] serious), and 31 (72%) of 43 patients in the placebo group (five [12%] serious).Etrolizumab was more likely to lead to clinical remission at week 10 than was placebo. Therefore, blockade of both ?4?7 and ?E?7 might provide a unique therapeutic approach for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and phase 3 studies have been planned.Genentech.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814090","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.83803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.821334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Genentech","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.690989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.597204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.552222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.305333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.262541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.0847228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"July 11","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_11"},{"name":"736","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/736"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
