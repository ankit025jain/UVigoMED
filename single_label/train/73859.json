{"id":73859,"title":"Current concepts in the surgical management of glioma patients.","abstract":"The scientific basis for the surgical management of patients with glioma is rapidly evolving. The infiltrative nature of these cancers precludes a surgical cure, but despite this, cytoreductive surgery remains central to high-quality patient care. In addition to tissue sampling for accurate histopathological diagnosis and molecular genetic characterisation, clinical benefit from decompression of space-occupying lesions and microsurgical cytoreduction has been reported in patients with different grades of glioma. By integrating advanced surgical techniques with molecular genetic characterisation of the disease and targeted radiotherapy and chemotherapy, it is possible to construct a programme of personalised surgical therapy throughout the patient journey. The goal of therapeutic packages tailored to each patient is to optimise patient safety and clinical outcome and must be delivered in a multidisciplinary setting. Here we review the current concepts that underlie surgical subspecialisation in the management of patients with glioma.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882149","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.782496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.635244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.384708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.024844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Anthropomorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
