{"id":76401,"title":"Aronia melanocarpa Elliot reduces the activity of angiotensin i-converting enzyme-in vitro and ex vivo studies.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of two-month supplementation with chokeberry preparation on the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). During the in vitro stage of the study, we determined the concentration of chokeberry extract, which inhibited the activity of ACE by 50% (IC50).The participants (n = 70) were divided into three groups: I-patients with MS who received chokeberry extract supplements, II-healthy controls, and III-patients with MS treated with ACE inhibitors.After one and two months of the experiment, a decrease in ACE activity corresponded to 25% and 30%, respectively. We documented significant positive correlations between the ACE activity and the systolic (r = 0.459, P = 0.048) and diastolic blood pressure, (r = 0.603, P = 0.005) and CRP. The IC50 of chokeberry extract and captopril amounted to 155.4 ± 12.1??g/mL and 0.52 ± 0.18??g/mL, respectively.Our in vitro study revealed that chokeberry extract is a relatively weak ACE inhibitor. However, the results of clinical observations suggest that the favorable hypotensive action of chokeberry polyphenols may be an outcome of both ACE inhibition and other pleotropic effects, for example, antioxidative effect.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25050143","annotations":[{"name":"Captopril","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captopril"},{"name":"ACE inhibitor","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.679095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.571318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme","weight":0.548228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.514899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Polyphenol antioxidant","weight":0.340536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol_antioxidant"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.30341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Aronia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aronia"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"}]}
