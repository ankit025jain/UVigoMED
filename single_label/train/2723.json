{"id":2723,"title":"Central precocious puberty: from physiopathological mechanisms to treatment.","abstract":"Puberty is a complex, coordinated biological process with multiple levels of regulations. The timing of puberty varies greatly in children and it is influenced by environmental, endocrine and genetic factors. Precocious puberty (PP) is an important issue, affecting between 1 in 5.000-10.000 children. The physiopathological mechanism is still unknown. From an etiological point of view, PP may be subdivided into gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -dependent and independent causes. GnRH-dependent PP, often called central precocious puberty (CPP), is based on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activation associated with progressive pubertal development, accelerated growth rate and advancement of skeletal age. Conversely, peripheral precocious puberty (PPP) is related to sex steroid exposure, independently of hypothalamic-?pituitary-?gonadal (HPG) axis activation. Kisspeptins play a central role in the modulation of GnRH secretion with peripheral factors that influence the timing of puberty, such as adipokines and endocrine disrupting chemicals. Moreover, PP could be related to genetic disorders, involving pivotal genes of the HPG axis. The standard test used to verify HPG activity is the gonadotropin response to administered GnRH analogs. We describe the physiopathological mechanisms of PP and its clinical implications, analysing diagnostic flow-chart and new potential biomarkers that could reveal PP. An update of the current literature was also carried out regarding the recent novelty for treatment.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316125","annotations":[{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.774143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.732235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Endocrine disruptor","weight":0.66619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.491559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Gigantism","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.347438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal_axis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.18939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Bone age","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_age"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
