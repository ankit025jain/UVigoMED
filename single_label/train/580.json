{"id":580,"title":"[Trend of susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of Candida species from aseptic samples in hospitals in Saitama prefecture].","abstract":"We investigated the susceptibility of Candida species from clinical aseptic samples, including blood, at some hospitals in Saitama prefecture. Candida spp. detected from aseptic samples in the 6 institutes in Saitama prefecture from November 2007 to July 2011 were studied. The number of isolates was 85, which are 43 (50.6%) of Candida albicans, 24 (28.2%) of Candida parapsilosis, 5 (5.9%) of Candida glabrata, 5 (5.9%) of Candida tropicalis, 4 (4.7%) of Candida guilliermondii, 2 (2.4%) of Candida fermentati, 1 (1.2%) of Candida famata and Candida lusitaniae, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, resistant isolates against micafungin were 3 in 5 of C. glabrata. We analyzed susceptibility of Candida spp. in Saitama prefecture in the article, and our study might be useful for the fungal therapy in the region.","date":"2014-11-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420317","annotations":[{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.456468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.451434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.336774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Saitama Prefecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saitama_Prefecture"},{"name":"Saitama, Saitama","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saitama,_Saitama"},{"name":"Micafungin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micafungin"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
