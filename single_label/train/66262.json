{"id":66262,"title":"Comparison of laboratory findings in patients with glomerulonephritis classified according to histopathologic diagnosis.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess whether laboratory investigations have predictional values for histopathological diagnosis of glomerulonephritis before performing renal biopsy.The study enrolled 452 patients, who underwent kidney biopsy and were examined retrospectively; 128 patients with the histopathological diagnosis of glomerulonephritis were included in the study. Serum CRP, albumin, uric acid levels, 24 hour urine protein presence, leucocyte count, C3, C4, IgG, IgA and IgM levels were assessed.The most common diagnosis of glomerulonephritis was IgAN with the percentage of 29.7% within the groups. Male gender was predominant except lupus group. Only the ones with crescentic glomerulonephritis had higher CRP levels. In 20% of patients with IgAN, in 8.3% of the ones with MN, in 35% of crescentic group, in 42% of FSGS group, in 30% of patients with MPGN and in 33% of the ones with lupus nephritis uric acid levels were found as elevated. In IgAN, FSGS and lupus nephritis normoalbuminemia and nephritic proteinuria, in MN and crescentic glomerulonephritis hypoalbuminemia, nephrotic proteinuria, in MPGN hypoalbuminemia, nephritic proteinuria were established. Serum Ig G levels were lower in MN and MPGN. Serum IgA levels were found as elevated in IgAN. Serum C4 levels were found as lower in lupus nephritis and MPGN.In patients admitted in clinical picture of glomerulopathy, since measurements of serum CRP, albumin, uric acid, C3, C4,IgG, IgA, IgM levels, leucocyte count and 24 hour urine protein amount can lead to predict the histopathological diagnosis, their significance in routine investigations has been suggested also in our study.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727879","annotations":[{"name":"Uric
