{"id":88677,"title":"A novel use of amniotic membrane for fingertip injuries.","abstract":"Fingertip injuries, which are the most common hand injury, represent management challenges for hand surgeons. Full thickness skin grafts are routinely used to cover the fingertip site, but has significant donor site morbidity. As amniotic membranes (AM) are used as a dressing substitute in burns, we decided to evaluate the efficacy of AM as a biologic wound dressing material for coverage of these injuries.In this clinical study, 30 patients with full-thickness zone 1 fingertip skin loss were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups using the block randomisation method. In the first group, a skin graft was used for coverage and in the second group, AM was used. All patients were operated on by the same hand surgeon between February 2012 to October 2012. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months. Two point discrimination (T.P.D), light touch, healing time, days lost from work and infection rate were evaluated and recorded.This study recruited 30 patients with full-thickness zone 1 fingertip skin loss (age range 13-47 years). Fingertips in both groups were assessed. T.P.D, light touch and days lost from work were significantly lower in the AM group than in the skin graft group. Healing time was lower in the skin graft group. In the both groups, no infection was detected. Patients of both groups were satisfied of their treatment and healing progress.Our results showed the effectiveness and safety of AM for the treatment of fingertip amputation, which can produce better sensation and functional outcomes than skin graft transplantations.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810309","annotations":[{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.815977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.506934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.436599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.382676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hand surgery","weight":0.362855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_surgery"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.312522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.231041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.223833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.201727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0719954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Amniotic sac","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_sac"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"}]}
