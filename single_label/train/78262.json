{"id":78262,"title":"Effects of expanded and standard captions on deaf college students' comprehension of educational videos.","abstract":"Twenty-two college students who were deaf viewed one instructional video with standard captions and a second with expanded captions, in which key terms were expanded in the form of vocabulary definitions, labeled illustrations, or concept maps. The students performed better on a posttest after viewing either type of caption than on a pretest; however, there was no difference in comprehension between standard and expanded captions. Camtasia recording software enabled examination of the extent to which the students accessed the expanded captions. The students accessed less than 20% of the available expanded captions. Thus, one explanation for the lack of difference in comprehension between the standard and expanded captions is that the students did not access the expanded captions sufficiently. Despite limited use of the expanded captions, the students stated, when interviewed, that they considered these captions beneficial in learning from the instructional video.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724309","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.353709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.320694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Concept map","weight":0.319609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map"},{"name":"College","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Illustration","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration"},{"name":"Vocabulary","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Camtasia Studio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camtasia_Studio"},{"name":"Typeface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Subtitle (captioning)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)"},{"name":"Closed captioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning"},{"name":"Instructional technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_technology"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"}]}
