{"id":74495,"title":"End-of-life decision-making in India.","abstract":"The extraordinary circumstances and the tragic life of Aruna Shanbaug, together with the landmark Supreme Court of India decision in Shanbaug v Union of India (2011) 4 SCC 454, have provided a fillip and focus to debate within India about end-of-life decision-making. This extends to passive euthanasia, decision-making about withdrawal of nutrition, hydration and medical treatment from persons in a permanent vegetative or quasi-vegetative state, the role of the courts in such matters, the risks of corruption and misconduct, the criminal status of attempted suicide, and even the contentious issue of physician-assisted active euthanasia. The debates have been promoted further by important reports of the Law Commission of India. This editorial reviews the current state of the law and debate about such issues in India.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341315","annotations":[{"name":"Supreme Court of India","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India"},{"name":"Euthanasia","weight":0.763537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.64468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.443286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"India","weight":0.441152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.376921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.343592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Supreme Court of the United States","weight":0.302914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Misconduct","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misconduct"},{"name":"Editorial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial"},{"name":"Dominion of India","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_India"},{"name":"Aruna Shanbaug case","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruna_Shanbaug_case"},{"name":"Law Commission of India","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Commission_of_India"},{"name":"Tragedy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Supreme Court of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada"},{"name":"Persistent vegetative state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_vegetative_state"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Union (American Civil War)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)"},{"name":"Law Commission (England and Wales)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Commission_(England_and_Wales)"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Parasuicide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasuicide"},{"name":"Law Commission","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Commission"}]}
