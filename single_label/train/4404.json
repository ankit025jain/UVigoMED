{"id":4404,"title":"[Distribution and schistosomiasis transmission risks of Biomphalaria straminea in inland China].","abstract":"Biomphalaria straminea, the intermediary host of Schistosoma mansoni, was found by survey in local areas of Shenzhen City in 1981, which was the first finding of the snail in inland China. By 2013, the snail had spread in large range of Shenzhen City and overspread to the surrounding regions, Dongguan City and Huizhou City. Due to the facts that Shenzhen City has many international communications and is a key area of labor export, with high population mobility, while the reports of S. mansoni infection in the returnees of our country from Africa have been increasing recently, it must be paid a high attention to whether the epidemic or transmission of schistosomiasis mansoni may happen under the present circumstance. This paper initially discusses the finding, distribution, spreading and overspreading and transmission risk of B. straminea in inland China and puts forward some related control suggestions.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345144","annotations":[{"name":"Africa","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"China","weight":0.59208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Dongguan","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongguan"},{"name":"Shenzhen","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.28825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Export","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Huizhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huizhou"},{"name":"Schistosoma mansoni","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_mansoni"},{"name":"Biomphalaria straminea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomphalaria_straminea"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Intermediary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediary"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Biomphalaria","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomphalaria"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Hong Kong returnee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_returnee"},{"name":"Population mobility","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_mobility"}]}
