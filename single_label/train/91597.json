{"id":91597,"title":"[Light-isotope water as a therapeutic agent for acute radiation disease].","abstract":"Eighty outbred CD-I male and female mice (initial body mass of 31-34 g) and 40 male Wistar rats (initial body mass of 280-360 g) were randomly distributed into the experimental and control groups by sex and body mass. According to the results of experiments, consumption of rectified light-isotope water over 30 days immediately after irradiation by gamma-quanta 60Co at 5 Gy and 6.5 Gy can increase survivability rate significantly, accelerate hemopoiesis recovery and prevent body mass loss in irradiated animals. Therefore, light-isotope water can be considered as an effective agent for treatment of the bone marrow syndrome.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490286","annotations":[{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.504832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.296263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.164056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.150717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Inbreeding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding"}]}
