{"id":34150,"title":"ACTH as a treatment for acute crystal-induced arthritis: update on clinical evidence and mechanisms of action.","abstract":"ACTH, a member of the melanocortin group of proteins, has long been used in the treatment of gout and is considered as an alternative therapeutic option, especially in difficult-to-treat patients.We performed a systematic electronic search (Medline and ScienceDirect) using the keywords gout, treatment, ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and pseudogout. We identified 5 studies assessing the efficacy of ACTH in acute crystal-induced arthritis.In the studies for acute gout, a total of 266 patients have been treated with ACTH; treatment was highly efficacious with a response rate of 77.9-100%. Only few side effects, such as hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and edema, were reported, all of which were mild. The available evidence for acute CPP crystal arthritis is limited. A total of 19 patients have been assessed in retrospective studies; the response rate was 90-100%, whereas no significant side effects were recorded. The mechanism of action of ACTH in acute crystal-induced arthritis is not entirely known but seems to extend beyond stimulation of steroid release from the adrenal glands; ACTH is able to stimulate melanocortin receptors on macrophages and downregulate gouty inflammation.Data suggests that ACTH is effective in acute crystal-induced arthritis and may be a first-line therapy in patients with multiple medical problems. We propose that further evaluation of ACTH should be performed, with a large-scale, randomized controlled study focusing on safety issues in patients with multiple comorbidities.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762710","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"},{"name":"Gout","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypokalemia","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.754652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.69893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.597988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.590017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.521785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.507022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.256946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Melanocortin","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Chondrocalcinosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocalcinosis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
