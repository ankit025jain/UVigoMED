{"id":45695,"title":"Simultaneous TAPP (transabdominal pre-peritoneal technique) for inguinal hernia and cholecystectomy - a feasible and safe procedure.","abstract":"Inguinal hernia repair and cholecystectomy are amongst the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. In the recent decades, early disease detection has notably increased due to easily accessible ultrasound. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and the possibility of performing a simultaneous hernia repair and cholecystectomy using the laparoscopic approach.Eight patients (M=100%) with inguinal hernia (3 with bilateral hernia) and cholelithiasis were included in the study. The presence of gallstones was confirmed by imaging. Mean age of the patients was 61.75 years (ranging from 47-72). Simultaneous laparoscopic cholecystectomy and transabdominal pre-peritoneal hernia repair was performed in all patients. Postoperative complications were analyzed to assess the safety and feasibility of the procedure.Mean operating time was 55 minutes (ranging from 30-60) and average length of stay was 3.625 days (ranging from 2-7). In order to perform a cholecystectomy, 1-2 additional trocars were used. No intra-operative complications were observed. At a follow-up visit on postoperative day 7, a small hematoma (10 ml of blood was punctured) in the right groin was noted in one patient. Another patient developed fever postoperatively, treated conservatively with antibiotics.Simultaneous TAPP and cholecystectomy proved to be a safe and feasible procedure. Acceptable operating time and hospital stay, as well as lack of influence on the length of convalescence, may present an interesting alternative to two separate procedures.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670337","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.679806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hernia repair","weight":0.414997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia_repair"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Convalescence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Inguinal canal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_canal"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"}]}
